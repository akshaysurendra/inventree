,,,A1022,3,1023,Edge effects reduce alpha-diversity but not beta-diversity during community assembly in a human-modified tropical forest,"Edge effects can alter the spatial organization of diversity in fragmented habitats. For tropical forests, however, there has been large variation in the strength and direction of such effects reported by different studies. For long-lived organisms like trees, one reason for inconsistent patterns might be due to most studies having examined patterns of diversity and compositional variation in older life stages that bear the legacy of a forest past. Younger life stages can reveal ongoing processes of assembly, but multi-stage examinations are rare. For seedling, sapling, and adult life stages of trees in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot (India), we examined how proximity to forest edges (edge influence) modified the spatial organization of diversity. Specifically, for each life stage we tested whether edge influence led to loss of alpha- and gamma-diversity and decreased beta-diversity in this landscape. We found lower alpha- and gamma-diversity closer to forest edges, but only for seedlings. Seedling composition at 90-100 m from forest edges diverged from composition of sites within 60 m, suggesting that edge influence restricted the recruitment of some species to interior sites. In contrast, beta-diversity was greater near edges than interior forest for all life stages and most prominently for seedlings. Furthermore, beta-diversity at edges was primarily driven by species turnover, suggesting either marked species-environment associations or dispersal limitation. Low turnover at 90-100 m implies that beta-diversity arose from stochastic fluctuations in occurrences and abundances of the same species set. Overall, we find that high beta-diversity structured spatial patterns of diversity near edges, but recruitment bottlenecks are likely to reduce alpha diversity of forest fragments. Our results also corroborate the need to maintain sufficiently large areas of tropical forest free from edge effects to avoid the loss of interior forest species. To improve landscape-scale diversity of fragmented landscapes, restoration efforts should focus on recovery of species that are unable to regenerate near forest edges.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1996,2019,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Krishnadas, M; Kumar, AN; Comita, LS",,Similar dataset as Osuri et al. 2016,Drainage network; water yield; sediment yield; LU; LC; calibration; watersheds,LAND-USE; WATERSHED SUBDIVISION; GIS; COVER; PRIORITIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; SUBWATERSHEDS; RUNOFF; CALIBRATION; SIMULATION,Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Kakinada; Infosys Limited,"[Parupalli, Sridhar] BVRM, SVECW, Civil Engn Dept, Bhimvaram, India; [Kumari, K.

This landscape comprises a mosaic of cultivation, human habitation and natural vegetation that has been heavily used by people. The natural vegetation is broadly divisible into four categories viz., grasslands, secondary scrub, old-fields and forests. Of these, the grasslands were the most species-rich followed by forests, secondary scrub and old-fields. A total of 615 species of angiosperms were recorded within an area of similar to 10,000 km(2) which represent 389 genera and 94 families. Sampling of forested landscape revealed a sizable number of rare species within frequency range of 0.001- 0.1%. These species showed very low seedling abundance and poor regeneration. The overall, landscape level diversity (gamma-diversity) of the forested landscape was 4.035, to which shrubs contributed the most. The scrub vegetation was dominated by woody climbers which frequently formed thickets. Diversity of woody perennials was very low in the plantations. The composition and diversity of various grassland communities have been compared with respect to topography and canopy openings reflecting different light regimes.

To describe the structural and functional differences in tree communities from interior to outside forests with in small PA, we quantitatively analyzed the vegetation of Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, a rich primate habitat of Northeast India. Vegetation was sampled at a parts per thousand yen10 cm girth at breast height by 10 m x 500 m sized 20 line transects (10 ha) laid in the interior (N = 7), peripheral (N = 7) and outside (N = 6) zones of this sanctuary. All transects were ordinated by Principal Component Analysis based on correlation between diversity and existing disturbance indices. We found significant differences (P < 0.05) in taxonomic richness and diversity indices between the habitat. Van diagram confirmed greater unique species richness in the interior zone (64) than peripheral (28) and outside (6) zones. Overall density (ha(-1)) did not differed across the zones, but basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) was significantly (P < 0.01) high in peripheral zone. Vertical distribution of stem density was linearly declined across zones ( > 0.70; P < 0.01) with increase in the canopy height. Horizontal distribution of adult stems showed significant inverse quadratic relationship ( > 0.80; P < 0.001), which suggests very low density of canopy forming voluminous trees in the interior zone.

,,,A1524,7,1525,Forest protection in Central India: do differences in monitoring by state and local institutions result in diverse social and ecological impacts?,"Protection of forests and wildlife outside protected areas (PAs) is necessary for the conservation of wildlife. Extension of conservation efforts outside the existing PA may result in restrictions on local forest resource use. Such situations arise due to differences in understanding of forest as a resource for communities and as a conservation space for endangered species. A clearer focus is needed on the functionality and socio-ecological outcomes of different forest management institutions to address such issues. We conducted a study in a forest landscape connecting Pench and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserves (TRs) in Central India. The two main forest management institutions were the Forest Department (FD) and local communities managing forest resources. We conducted vegetation surveys and focus group discussions in 15 villages selected based on presence or absence of active protection and monitoring of forest resources by either FD or local people. We found that forests with monitoring had significantly higher tree density and vegetation species richness compared to forests without monitoring. Tree density was observed to be higher in sites monitored by villagers rather than those monitored by FD. Self-regulation and resource sharing in locally monitored forests were more acceptable to local communities. In forests monitored by the FD, local communities indicated a feeling of alienation from the forest that weakened their motivation to protect the forest and wildlife. Recognition of local community rights is essential to achieve conservation goals and reduce social conflicts outside PAs, requiring collaboration between state and local institutions.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1344-6,2017,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Agarwal, S; Marathe, A; Ghate, R; Krishnaswamy, J; Nagendra, H",,,Climbing guilds; Dispersal mode; Liana abundance; Natural patches; Shade tolerance; Species-area relationships,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; EVERGREEN FORESTS; WESTERN-GHATS; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; ANTHROPOGENIC EDGES; NILGIRI MOUNTAINS; SEEDLING SURVIVAL; DIVERSITY; TREE; FRAGMENTATION,Chinese Academy of Sciences; James Cook University; James Cook University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangxi University; Pondicherry University; Bharathiar University,"[Mohandass, Dharmalingam; Mammides, Christos] Chinese Acad Sci, XTBG, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun Town 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Campbell, Mason J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Trop Environm & Sustainabil Sci TESS, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Campbell, Mason J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Cairns, Qld 4878, Australia; [Hughes, Alice C.] Chinese Acad Sci, XTBG, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Menglun Town 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Mammides, Christos] Guangxi Univ, Coll Forestry, Guangxi Key Lab Forest Ecol & Conservat, Daxuedonglu 100, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Davidar, Priya] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Kalapet 605014, Puducherry, India; [Mohandass, Dharmalingam] Bharathiar Univ, Dept Bot, Root & Soil Biol Lab, Coimbatore 641046, Tamil Nadu, India","Mohandass, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, XTBG, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Menglun Town 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",ECOS; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31200173]; Center for Tropical Forest Science and assistance,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated ecosystem-level C stock using data from 70 forest plots in three major forest types: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forests (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) of Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India. The average C stock in these forests was 336.8Â MgÂ C/ha, of which 231.3, 3.0, 2.4, 15.2 and 84.9Â MgÂ C/ha were stored in woody vegetation, understorey, litter, deadwood and soil respectively. The live vegetation, detritus and soil contributed 65.5%, 5.5% and 29% respectively to the total ecosystem-level C stock and distributed in forest types in the order: TEF IIIâ€‰>â€‰TEF IIâ€‰>â€‰TEF Iâ€‰>â€‰TSE Iâ€‰>â€‰TDD IIâ€‰>â€‰TSE IIâ€‰>â€‰TDD I. The plant diversity, structural attributes and environmental factors showed significant positive correlations with C stocks and accounted for 6.7, 77.2 and 16% of variance. These findings indicate that the tropical forests in the Western Ghats store large amount of C, and resulting data are invaluable for planning and monitoring forest conservation and management programs to enhance C storage in tropical forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70313-6,2020,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Kothandaraman, S; Dar, JA; Sundarapandian, S; Dayanandan, S; Khan, ML",,,Emission reduction; Renewable energy; Sustainable development; Developing country,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CARBON EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; PAKISTAN; ELECTRICITY; FOOTPRINT; RENEWABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; CHALLENGES,Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Lancaster University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"[Ali, Mustafa] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Ali, Mustafa; Liu, Lingxuan] Univ Lancaster, Pentland Ctr, Lancaster LA1 1YW, England; [Khokhar, Shahid] Univ Educ, Lahore, Pakistan; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Inst Pollut Control & Ecol Secur, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China","Ali, M (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.;Geng, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.","Natural Science Foundation of China [71850410539, 71810107001, 71690241]; Ministry of Science and Technology, China [2019YFC1908500]",,,,,,,,,,

Four 2-ha contiguous permanent plots were erected, one each in Perumakkai shola (site PS), Vengodai shola (VS), Kuzhivalavu shola (KS) and Mottukkadu shola (MS) at 1000, 1050, 1200 and 1250 m elevation, with increasing human disturbance, to evaluate the difference in tree species composition, stand structure and dynamics. This paper discusses the results of the first survey. A total of 3825 individuals and 78 species from 61 genera and 36 families were enumerated in the 8 ha area. Among the four 2-ha sites, species richness was greatest (58) in the undisturbed site PS and lowest (39) in the highly disturbed site MS. Shannon, Simpson, Hill diversity and evenness indexes revealed a progressive reduction in diversity with increasing disturbance. The asymptote species-area curves imply adequate site sampling. Tree density (1151 to 651 trees ha(-2)) and basal area (106 to 46.6 m(2) ha(-2)) decreased from undisturbed to disturbed site, due to selective felling. Single species, Memecylon umbellatum dominated sites MS (39%) and VS (26%), while Nothopegia heyneana, Memecylon umbellatum and Diospyros ovalifolia were dominant in PS, and Meliosma simplicifolia, Myristica dactyloides and Phoebe wightii in KS. Based on species abundance, we classify the study area as Memecylon-Phoebe-Beilschmiedia association with Neolitsea and Myristica as codominants. Tree population structure revealed a step-wise decline in girth frequencies with increasing size class in undisturbed site PS, whereas tree density fell sharp (> 50%) in medium girth class in the disturbed site MS. Population of the dominant species varied widely. The diversity values of this inventory are compared with similar studies in India and other tropical forests. Evidently, the reduction in species richness (by 52%), basal area (56%) and tree density (58%) in disturbed sites, with 57.6% of species rarity of this tropical evergreen forest, in secluded patches ('sholas') of Kolli hills, underlines conservation need to prevent species loss.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008971015545,2000,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Chittibabu, CV; Parthasarathy, N",,,,,Osmania University,"SGS India Ltd, Terr Environm Serv, Secunderabad 500003, AP, India; Mapping Earth Resources & Informat Technol, Hyderabad 500047, Andhra Pradesh, India; Osmania Univ, OU Coll Sci, Dept Zool, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India",,,,,,,,,,,,

India has 71 million ha (M ha) of land under forests represented by tropical to alpine ecosystems. Numerous direct and indirect species-specific and mixed-species equations have been used for biomass estimation in India. Biomass estimation equations that facilitate the prediction of aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks non-destructively across India are still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this review is to (i) assess the existing species-specific biomass estimation equations for trees, bamboos, palms, and bananas in India, (ii) assess and identify the most appropriate multi-species biomass estimation equations for AGB estimation across India, and (iii) define the critical research gaps in biomass estimation in India. The literature search found 85 species-specific and six multi-species AGB estimation equations reported from India. It was also found that a 50% of these equations were based on the power-law function using diameter at breast height (D) as the predictor variable. We carried out a multi-fold validation to compare the multi-species equation's compatibility by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE). The estimated RMSE values of the six reported multi-species equations showed that the following two equations could be effectively used for estimation of AGB: (i) lnAGB= 0.349+1.316 lnGBH and (ii) AGB= (0.18D2.16) × 1.32.

,,,A1032,11,1033,"Phytosociology of stratification in a lowland tropical rainforest occurring north of the Tropic of Cancer in Meghalaya, India","Stratification in lowland rainforests of Meghalaya, India, which represent the westernmost limit of the rainforests north of the Tropic of Cancer, was studied in horizontal and vertical planes to elucidate the patterns in stacking of species diversity and community attributes, and to draw comparisons with rainforests of 'Indo-Malaya' ecozone (biogeographical realm). All individuals >= 10 cm GBH (girth at breast height) were enumerated in six transects of 10 m width and up to 500 m length covering 2.45 ha area. The stratification of whole assemblage of species in vertical plane is referred to as 'storey structure' (=height class distribution), which explains structural complexity. In horizontal plane, it is typically referred to as 'stand structure' (=girth class distribution), which explains structural heterogeneity. The stratification of an individual species in vertical plane is referred to as 'loftiness' and in horizontal plane, it is frequently referred to as 'population structure'. The stand structure was characterized by a negative exponential relationship or a reverse J-shaped curve, which is typical of a well regenerating forest stand. The storey structure was characterized by the low stature of the rainforest (<30 m), subtle layering in the canopy with dearth of discrete multi-stories, narrower widths of the stories and a thick understory. The cluster analysis and 'candlestick charts' showed that the dominant species spatially segregated in canopy height to profile three strata, viz., an understory of juveniles and shrubs below 5 m, a middle-storey of intermediate trees between 5 and 15 m, and an overstory of large trees between 15 and 25 m. Emergent trees of a few species may reach up to 30 m. The individuals tended to scatter in increasingly wider range of height classes from a lower to the next higher girth class, creating a 'torchlight scatter' pattern, with a tendency to concentrate towards smaller height classes due to stochastic factors, which potentially influence vertical growth proportionate to diametric growth. In comparison to equatorial rainforests of Malaysia and seasonal rainforests of southwestern China, the rainforests of Meghalaya are short-statured at the geographic extremity of the occurrence of rainforest biome in Asia-Pacific region, owing to floristic composition, site quality factors, excessively higher quantities of rainfall and high differential of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Despite limited diversity of megaphanerophytes, these rainforests deserve concerted conservation efforts as they stack high diversity of meso-, micro- and nano-phanerophytes.

,,,A1341,12,1342,A systematic review on the aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of Indian forest ecosystems,"Background: Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India. Result: There are six major forest types found in India consisting of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates are based on nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small-and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and Agrosilviculture also play an important role in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem. Conclusion: The systematic literature review was carried out to gather and summarize information from different studies conducted on forest ecosystems and quantification methods used for biomass estimation and carbon stock in different forests types and states of India. In general, great variability occurs in aboveground biomass and carbon stock on account of climatic and geographic differences. To obtain good and accurate estimations, following nondestructive approach, species-specific density-based equations are required from different habitats and also in relation to degradation status of forests. As such regional volume equations would increase error of estimations. The comprehensive account of data would be helpful to formulate strategies based on carbon sequestration in Indian forests for CO2 mitigation.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-018-0130-z,2018,ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Salunkhe, O; Khare, PK; Kumari, R; Khan, ML",,,Automation; chest X-rays; lung region symmetry; pulmonary abnormalities; screening; tuberculosis,RAPID MOLECULAR-DETECTION; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; TUBERCULOSIS; SHAPE; RADIOGRAPHS; SEGMENTATION; NETWORKS; FEATURES; LIVER,University of South Dakota; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM),"[Santosh, K.

Location The Linganamakki region (State of Karnataka) of the Central Western Ghats of India. Method We selected thirty vegetation thickets ranging from 4 to 439 m(2) in area in the vicinity of rain forest. The area of each small thicket was estimated as an oval using its maximum length and its maximum width. When the shape was irregular (mostly in large thickets) the limits of the thicket were mapped and the area calculated from the map. Plant species were identified, the number of individuals was estimated and their heights measured. Results There was a progression in the thickets from early to late successional species. Small thickets were characterized by ecotone species and savanna trees such as Catunaregam dumetorum . Savanna trees served as a nucleus for thicket formation. Colonizing species were mostly bird-dispersed. As succession proceeded in larger thickets, the proportion of evergreen, late-successional rain forest trees increased. The species composition of the large thickets differed depending on the species composition of reproductive adults in the nearby forested areas. The species within small thickets were also found in the large thickets. The nestedness in species composition suggested that species turnover was deterministic based on thicket size. Human disturbance (leaf and wood collection by the local populations) affected the species composition and the species-area relationship of thickets. Main conclusions Vegetation thickets are nodal centres for rain forest colonization within grasslands. They expand and replace savanna. Early successional bird-dispersed species established around savanna trees followed by late-successional rain forest trees dispersed from the nearby forest by birds. Restoration programmes that reproduce natural successional processes such as those observed in thickets will be more successful and less expensive than the methods currently being employed, where trees are individually planted in grassland. Wood harvesting is the only factor that prevents thicket growth and coalescence and hampers forest expansion.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00882.x,2003,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Puyravaud, JP; Dufour, C; Aravajy, S",,,,DNA EXTRACTION; MARKERS; ACCESSIONS; RESOURCES; BARLEY; PEACH,University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, GKVK, Div Hort, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, GKVK, Dept Biotechnol, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Indian Inst Sci, Dept Microbiol & Cell Biol, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India","Shashidhara, G (corresponding author), Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, GKVK, Div Hort, Plant Mol Biol Lab, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2450,14,2451,Vegetation types of East Ladakh: species and growth form composition along main environmental gradients,"Question The vegetation of high mountain regions in Himalaya remains poorly assessed despite the expected vulnerability of these ecosystems to global change drivers. What are the main vegetation types in East Ladakh and which environmental factors influence the species composition and growth forms distribution? Location The south-westernmost extension of the Tibetan Plateau, an arid mountainous area, in East Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir State, India. Methods Species composition was recorded for 369 plots (each 100 m2). Plots, sampled from 4180 m a.s.l. (bottom of the Indus Valley) up to 6060 m a.s.l. (close to the snowline), covered a wide range of environmental conditions. Results TWINSPAN clusters discriminated eight ecologically interpretable vegetation types, corresponding to the main habitats in the area: animal resting places, salt marshes, semi-deserts and steppes, shrublands, alpine screes and boulder fields, alpine grasslands, water bodies and subnival zone. The most important environmental factors influencing the species composition were altitude, soil moisture and salinity. Screes and alpine grasslands were found to be the most species-rich. The species were ranged into 20 growth forms with regard to life-form and clonality, with growth forms showing different changes in proportion among vegetation types and along the different environmental gradients. Conclusion The study summarizes the main vegetation types of East Ladakh in terms of species and growth form compositions. The results can have a heuristic value for designing future monitoring schemes and assess the effects of global change in these diverse, but poorly studied, regions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-109X.2010.01103.x,2011,APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Dvorsky, M; Dolezal, J; de Bello, F; Klimesova, J; Klimes, L",,,"deforestation; forest dynamics; GIS remote sensing; tropical forest; Malkangiri, Orissa",LAND-USE; LANDSCAPE CHANGE; CHANGBAI MOUNTAIN; EASTERN GHATS; DEFORESTATION; FRAGMENTATION; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; AREA; BIODIVERSITY,"Salim Ali Center for Ornithology & Natural History (SACON); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Osmania University","[Chiranjibi, Pattanaik] Salim Ali Ctr Ornithol & Nat Hist, Hyderabad 500017, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Sudhakar, C.

,,,A1535,15,1536,Impact of biogas interventions on forest biomass and regeneration in southern India,"Programs to provide alternative energy sources such as biogas improve indoor air quality and potentially reduce pressure on forests from fuelwood collection. This study tests whether biogas intervention is associated with higher forest biomass and forest regeneration in degraded forests in Chikkaballapur district in Southern India. Using propensity score matching, we find that forest plots in proximity to villages with biogas interventions (treatment) had greater forest biomass than comparable plots around villages without biogas (control). We also found significantly higher sapling abundance and diversity in treatment than control plots despite no significant difference in seedling abundances and diversity in treatment forests, suggesting that plants have a higher probability of reaching sapling stage. These results indicate the potential for alternative energy sources that reduce dependence on fuelwood to promote regeneration of degraded forests. However, forest regrowth is not uniform across treatments and is limited by soil nutrients and biased towards species that are light demanding, fire-resistant and can thrive in poor soil conditions.

A change was noted in the above region due to physiographic differences and anthropogenic disturbances. Annually the soil moisture (SM) content across the different study sites ranged from 7.5 to 24.3% being maximum in forest sites compared to savanna and cropland sites. The NH4+-N, NO3--N and MB-N concentrations varied from 4.3 to 10.2 mu g/g, 1.1 to 5.8 mu g/g and 21.3 to 90.2 mu g/g dry soil, respectively, with minimum values in the wet and maximum values in the dry season. The trend of seasonal variation in net N-mineralization was similar to that of moisture content but counter to the concentrations of inorganic-N and MB-N. The net N-mineralization rates at different investigated sites ranged from 4.5 to 37.6 mu g/g month. Cultivation reduced the N-mineralization and MB-N by 58.5% and 63.5%. respectively. Experiments showed that the percentage contribution of MB-N to total-N was 8.01 to 19.15%. MB-N was positively correlated with the inorganic-N (n = 180, r = 0.80, P < 0.001) but negatively with soil moisture (n = 180, r = 0.79, P < 0.001) and net N-mineralization rates (n = 180, r = 0.92, P < 0.0001).

In the 1980s, the State Government of Rajasthan declared wildlife-rich areas (14690 km(2)) located outside PA, as Closed Areas (CA) to prohibit hunting activities. In 2002, due to an amendment of the WPA of 1972, these CA lost their PA status, thus putting into question, the future of these endangered species-rich ecosystems. To inform future management decisions, a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted across seven former CA in the arid landscapes of western Rajasthan. Furthermore, the dynamics of biodiversity and conservation practices over time was also assessed through interviews of 3357 adults from 2470 households in the region. Due to the natural low productivity of arid regions, the mean tree density (5.2 +/- 0.8 individual ha(-1)) was found significantly lower (P = 0.001) than the mean shrub density (114.4 +/- 31.4 individual ha(-1)) particularly where human interferences were recorded, while species richness and diversity (Sobs and Shannon indices) were higher for trees (16 +/- 0.0 and 2.4, respectively) than the shrubs (13 +/- 0.1 and 1.8, respectively). Prosopis cineraria was assessed, as the most dominant and exploited tree species. Ecological densities of all the wild ungulates (11.7 +/- 1.8 individual km(-2)) were quite comparable to other well-guarded PA of India. However, high density of domestic livestock (94.6 +/- 7.2 individual km(-2)) provides severe competition to them. Indian desert fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), adapted to survive amongst human dominated landscapes, were the most abundant canids (0.9 +/- 0.2 individual km(-2) and 0.6 +/- 0.1 individual km(-2), respectively), where the latter was considerably responsible for wild ungulate mortalities. State Government records and over 69% of the interviewees (n = 2331) reported that the region's wildlife populations had significantly declined during the past two decades in absence of any designated protection regime. Therefore, to protect this endangered biodiversity, reconsideration of the future conservation status of these former CA should be prioritized, as Conservation Reserves - CR or Community Conservation Reserves - CCR with the assistance of local communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2018.07.006,2018,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,"Bhattacharjee, S; Kidwai, Z; Bhattarai, S; Bajpai, H; Reddy, GV; Yessoufou, K",,,carbon sequestration; fallow period; greenhouse gas emission; payments for ecosystem services; secondary forest regeneration; slash and burn,BIODIVERSITY CO-BENEFITS; BURN AGRICULTURE; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SECONDARY FORESTS; SWIDDEN CULTIVATION; TROPICAL FORESTS; RAIN-FORESTS; LARGE TREES; DYNAMICS; REGION,University of Sheffield,"[Borah, Joli R.; Evans, Karl L.; Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Borah, JR (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",ACCE (Adapting to the Challenges of a Changing Environment) Doctoral Training Partnership,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed (2.4 ha) in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed (2.1 ha) in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed (2.7 ha) outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class (> 210 cm GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands. With a species rarity (species having < 2 individuals) of ca. 50%, the tropical wet evergreenforests of the Namdapha National Park and its adjacent areas warrant more protection from human intervention and also eco-development to meet the livelihood requirements of the local inhabitants in the peripheral areas of the Namdapha National Park in order to reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the natural resources of the park.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-4361-1,2005,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Nath, PC; Arunachalam, A; Khan, ML; Arunachalam, K; Barbhuiya, AR",,,sodic soil; Casuarina glauca; growth; regressions equations; biomass productivity,BIOMASS PRODUCTION; FUELWOOD PRODUCTION; EQUISETIFOLIA; LEUCAENA; SELECTION,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI),"Natl Bot Res Inst, Biomass Biol Div, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India","Behl, HM (corresponding author), Natl Bot Res Inst, Biomass Biol Div, 1 Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we explore the potential of satellite datasets in identifying the patterns in species richness in part of three global biodiversity hotspots falling in India viz., Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats. We used generalized linear models to correlate remote sensing based vegetation indices (VIs) and physiographic indices (PIs) with plant richness calculated using 1264, 1114, and 1004 field plots across 21 different forest vegetation classes in Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats respectively. Three different vegetation indices ranked highest in explaining the variance in plant richness in the three hotspots. The variance in species richness explained by models based on only VIs was highest (69%, P<0.01) for Bamboo vegetation in Indo Burma hotspot with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, followed by that for dry deciduous forest in Western Ghats (57%, P<0.001) with Normalized Difference Water Index, and for grasslands (54%, P<0.05) in Himalaya by Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The explained variance increased with combined models that are based on PIs and VIs to up to 85% (P<0.05). Overall, we observed very high correlation between VIs and plant richness in open canopy vegetation classes with low species richness such as grasslands, scrubs, and dry deciduous forests, followed by vegetation classes with moderately dense canopy. Our study provides crucial insights on utility of satellite datasets as a proxy for estimating plant richness for better conservation of diverse ecosystems.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01761-4,2019,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Chitale, VS; Behera, MD; Roy, PS",,,Ecological indices; Invasive; Morphotypes; Parthenium; Soil chemistry,PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; PLASTICITY; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; ASTERACEAE; HABITATS; RICHNESS; GENETICS,Panjab University; Panjab University; Central University of Punjab,"[Kaur, Amarpreet; Kaur, Shalinder; Batish, Daizy Rani; Kohli, Ravinder Kumar] Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Chandigarh 160014, India; [Singh, Harminder Pal] Panjab Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Chandigarh 160014, India; [Kohli, Ravinder Kumar] Cent Univ Punjab, Mansa Rd, Bathinda 151001, India","Batish, DR (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Chandigarh 160014, India.",University Grants Commission (India),,,,,,,,,,

The logged forest harbored lower stem density of mature trees (508 ha(-1)) than unlogged ones (630 ha(-1)). Indeed, logging operations increased the species diversity in the regenerative phase (seedling phase) due to the creation of larger canopy gaps. The extra radiation reaching the ground, facilitated the colonization of early and late secondary species. Ramakrishanan Index of Stand Quality (RISQ) values in logged forest was higher in comparison with unlogged forest, indicating the dominance of early and late secondary species, especially at sapling phase.

Here we refine and test eight hypotheses to evaluate causes of a richness peak in trees of the eastern Himalaya. In the field, we enumerated trees in 50 plots of size 0.1 ha each at eight zones along an elevational gradient and compared richness patterns with interpolation of elevational ranges of species from a thorough review of literature, including floras from the plains of India. The maximum number of species peaks at similar elevations in the two data sets (at 500 m in the field sampling and between 500 m and 1,000 m in range interpolation); concordance between the methods implies that statistical artefacts are unlikely to explain the peak in the data. We reject most hypotheses (e.g., area, speciation rate, mixing of distinct floras). We find support for a model in which climate (actual evapotranspiration [AET] or its correlates) sets both the number of species and each species optimum, coupled with a geometric constraint. We consider that AET declines with elevation, but an abrupt change in the association of AET with geographical distance into the plains means that the location of highest AET, at the base of the mountain, receives range overlaps from fewer species than the location just above the base. We formalize this explanation with a mathematical model to show how this can generate the observed low-elevation richness peak.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2548,2019,ECOLOGY,"Rana, SK; Gross, K; Price, TD",,,Fallow lands; Fine root biomass; Fine root turnover; Shifting cultivation; Subtropical semi evergreen forest,VEGETATION; PATTERNS; CARBON; STAND; INTENSIFICATION; RESILIENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; TURNOVER; BIOMASS; TRAIT,Mizoram University,"[Wapongnungsang; Tripathi, S.

,,,A0544,26,545,Conservation of Plant Diversity in Agroforestry Systems in a Biodiversity Hotspot Region of Northeast India,"In Assam, a north-eastern state of India, most of the traditional agroforestry systems are still practised. The plant species composition of three agroforestry systems namely homegardens tea gardens and agrisilvicultural systems, were assessed using quadrat method. A total of 516 plant species belonging to 241 genera under 91 families were recorded, which consisted of 134 trees, 143 shrubs (67 shrub species and 76 species of saplings) and 239 herbs (93 herb species, 33 climber species and 113 species of seedlings). Homegardens had the highest species richness (475 plant species) belonging to 234 genera under 90 families. This was followed by agrisilvicultural systems (101 spp., 43 genera, 29 families), and the least was in tea gardens (79 spp., 41 genera, 25 families). The highest average number of plant species per system was recorded in homegarden (108.96 ± 5.96, range 23–207 spp.). A negative correlation was found between the agroforestry system plot size and plant species richness. Sorenson’s similarity index showed a very low degree of similarity in the plant species recorded among the three selected systems. Out of 516 plant species recorded across the different agroforestry systems, 1.0% species (n = 3) were vulnerable (Aquilaria malaccensis, Saraca asoca and Santalum album), 8.9% species (n = 46) were least concerned, 1.6% species (n = 8) were data deficient and 88.6% species (n = 457) were not assessed. Only homegarden recorded all the three plant species under the vulnerable category of IUCN Red List. It can be concluded that the agroforestry systems, specially the homegardens harbour rich plant diversity and act as miniature versions of natural forests by conserving rare, threatened and data-deficient plant species. The results suggest that the agroforestry systems with some management interventions need to be promoted as conservation models in areas with high pressure on tropical forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40003-020-00525-9,2021,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Yashmita-Ulman; Singh, M; Kumar, A; Sharma, M",,,Haplotype; Mitochondrial DNA; Population structure; Silond catfish; Southeast Asia,CATFISH; BIOGEOGRAPHY,University of Yangon; Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology; Khulna University,"[Soe, Toe Toe; Thwe, Thida Lay; Aye, Pwint Thu; Myint, Kyi Thar] Univ Yangon, Dept Zool, Kamayut Township 11041, Yangon, Myanmar; [Lwin, Than Than; Thaung, Ye Win; Min, Aye Aye] Minist Agr Livestock & Irrigat, Dept Fisheries, Naypyitaw, Myanmar; [Mitsui, Shota; Terahara, Takeshi; Endo, Masato; Yokota, Masashi; Kobayashi, Takeshi] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088477, Japan; [Rahman, M.

Site TM is twofold more voluminous (basal area 29.48 m(2) ha(-1)) than KK (basal area 15.44 m(2) ha(-1)). Nearly one third of the individuals are multi-stemmed in the low-statured site KK whereas one fourth of the tree density is multi-stemmed in TM. Species abundance pattern varied between the two sites. The abundance of three species in KK and two species in TM is pronounced. Memecylon umbellatum, the most abundant species contributing to one third of total stand density in KK, is least represented in TM. Species richness, density and diversity indices decreased with increasing girth threshold. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 and 1-ha scales. Population structure for girth frequency is an expanding one for both the sites, except for basal area distribution in KK. Variations in plant diversity and abundance are related to site attributes and human impacts.

,,,C0065,28,3355,Does structural connectivity influence tree species distributions and abundance in a naturally discontinuous tropical forest formation?,"Aims: The study of naturally discontinuous forest systems could help further
our understanding of the relative roles of abiotic factors and spatial connectivity
in influencing species turnover and plant metacommunity structure, compared
to continuous forest formations, where local communities are often arbitrarily
defined and where ‘mass effects’ and source–sink dynamics tend to confound
the roles of dispersal and environment. Here we studied a tropical montane
landscape where old-growth evergreen forest occurs as patchy formations in a
matrix of natural grasslands, to test the influence of environment and connectivity on species turnover and woody plant metacommunity structure.
Location: Western and southern regions of the Upper Nilgiri Plateau, Western
Ghats, southern India.
Methods: We sampled 85 vegetation plots located across a 600-km2 landscape,
assembled environmental data, constructed contrasting spatial connectivity
models, including models for the effects of topography on structural connectivity, and used RDA-based variation partitioning to assess the relative influence of
environment and space on woody plant metacommunity structure.
Results: Considering several environmental and multi-scale spatial predictors,
we could explain half of the variation in plant community structure. Environmental and habitat factors such as precipitation, temperature seasonality, elevation, fragment size and landscape context play a dominant role, explaining
approximately 40% of variation. Spatial predictors based on Euclidean distance
performed better than those that accounted for topographic resistance. Spatial
predictors accounted for only 9% of the variation in plant metacommunity
structure.
Conclusion: Our results support the species sorting paradigm of metacommunity
structure, as abiotic effects and biotic interactions play dominant roles in influencing community structure and species turnover in these old-growth forests, with a
comparatively small influence of spatial connectivity. Effective management of
woody species diversity would therefore require conservation of these forests
across the range of environmental conditions under which they occur",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2017,JVS,"AA Das, R John, M Anand",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A0552,29,553,"Above ground biomass carbon assessment using field, satellite data and model based integrated approach to predict the carbon sequestration potential of major land use sector of Arunachal Himalaya, India","The land-use sector needs special importance owing to its ability to store and emit carbon back to the atmosphere. Land-use changes and their correlations could elucidate conditions that put forests at risk of conversion to other land uses. The impact of rapid forest cover change tends to reduce the percentage of forest cover, thereby reducing the potential for carbon storage in woody biomass. The study was conducted in the state of Arunachal Pradesh to estimate the above-ground biomass, carbon pool and sequestration potential of major land-use sectors. The above-ground biomass of selected land-uses viz. dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest, plantations, Jhum >5 years, Jhum <5 years and current jhum are 332.28 t ha−1, 246.63 t ha−1, 145.36 t ha−1, 179.31 t ha−1, 149.63 t ha−1, 55.40 t ha−1, 16.84 t ha−1 respectively. The developed model is derived from Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) for prediction of above-ground biomass (AGB) (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.05). The resultant R2 value of 85% predicts that 79% of accuracy could be assumed by the model. The RMSE of the model was 53.21 t ha−1, having no multicollinearity problem keeping tolerance (0.49) and VIF (2.80). The spatial AGB density map was predicted using a step-wise linear regression model which used AGB, SAVI and ARVI of the corresponding sample plot location. The implication of the land-use change revealed that about 84% carbon will be lost from dense forest once it is converted to Jhum (Jhum is the alternate name of Shifting cultivation in India) followed by Jhum <5 years (65%). It is pertinent to mention here that, the present analysis will help the policymakers in visualizing a proper developmental goal to regulate land-use changes for achieving the higher carbon stock and maintaining balance in the global climate scenario",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2021.1899753,2021,CARBON MANAGEMENT,"Das, B; Bordoloi, R; Deka, S; Paul, A; Pandey, PK; Singha, LB; Tripathi, OP; Mishra, BP; Mishra, M",,,Ingrowth core; Sequential core; Fine root turnover; Fine root decomposition; Pruning; Allometric models,,,"[Rocha, Delphy; Santhoshkumar, A.

In the present study, high-altitude dry temperate land use systems (LUS) at three altitudinal ranges A(1), 1900-2170 m. a.s.l., A(2), 2170-2440 m.a.s.l., and A(3), 2440-2710 m.a.s.l. were selected based on lapse rates in Kinnur district of Himachal Pradesh, India. The study was aimed at estimating the difference in biomass and carbon stocks in different land use systems and recommendation of the suitable environment-friendly land use for the region. Six land use systems viz.; agriculture, horticulture, agrihorticulture, agri-horti-silviculture, silvipasture, and barren land common at all the three altitudes were selected for experimental setup. Results: Maximum mean aboveground biomass (84.65 t ha(-1)), belowground biomass (19.50 t ha(-1)), and total biomass (104.10 t ha(-1)) were recorded in the silvipasture land use system. Total biomass production of different land use systems followed the order: silvipasture > agri-horti-silviculture > agrihorticulture > horticulture > agriculture > barren land respectively. Maximum soil organic carbon (1.41%) was recorded in silvipasture land use systems, which however remained statistically at par with the organic carbon contents of horticulture. Soil organic carbon, irrespective of the land use system increased with increase in altitudinal range and decreased with increase in soil depth. Maximum carbon density (155.77 t ha(-1)) in 0-100 cm layer was in agri-horticulture LUS. The order of carbon density under different land use systems was agri-horticulture > agri-horti-silviculture > silvipasture > horticulture > agriculture > barren land. Irrespective of the land use system, the carbon density at different altitudinal gradient followed the trend A(1), 1900-2170 m.a.s.l., > A(3), 2440-2710 m.a.s.l and > A(2), 2170-2440 m.a.s.l.

International markets for climate regulation represent an 'anchor service' potentially promoting TDEF restoration, co-beneficially generating multiple linked ecosystem services. Understanding the forest type and carbon sequestration rate is essential to underpin these markets. Literature suggests that TDEF is a broad categorisation of forest types shaped by environmental conditions and human pressures, a plastic biome rather than a definitive vegetation type, though regionally representative if now highly fragmented. Previous estimates of carbon sequestration potential in restored TDEF were found to be flawed, calculated from incorrectly stated units in a source paper. Structured literature review confirms the sparsity of relevant literature, though the distinctive nature of TDEF makes data transfer from other forest types unreliable. From the limited literature, carbon sequestration potential from restoration of TDEF is of the order of 292 tC ha(-1) (1071 tCO(2)eha(-1)), subject to multiple stated assumptions and significant uncertainty that is unquantifiable based on limited data.

The total area of forest was decreased by 28%, whereas open cropped area increased by more than 100%. The conversion of forests into other land uses resulted in a remarkable decline in the C densities. Across the land-use cover, total mean C densities ranged from 46 Mg ha(-1) in open cropped area temperate to a high of 669 Mg ha(-1) in temperate natural dense forest. The heavily converted areas lost an estimated 55% of their total 1988 C pools, whereas the low-impacted areas lost only 0.12%. Changes in land use released 7.78 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), demonstrating that land-use changes significantly affected C flux. Therefore, the conversion of forest to agriculture land should be reversed. Agroforestry systems should be included in agricultural land in mountainous regions. The policy relevance of this work is immediate.

,,,B0010,35,3355,Greater stability of carbon capture in species-rich natural forests compared to species-poor plantations,"Abstract Tree plantations and forest restoration are leading strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration and mitigating climate change. While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercial monoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear. Using a natural experiment in the Western Ghats of India, where late-20th century conservation laws prohibited timber extraction from monodominant plantations and natural forests within nature reserves, we assessed forests and plantations for aboveground C storage and the magnitude and temporal stability of rates of photosynthetic C capture (gross primary production). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that species-rich forests show greater temporal stability of C capture, and are more resistant to drought, than monodominant plantations. Carbon stocks in monodominant teak ( Tectona grandis ) and Eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp. ) plantations were 30%â€“50% lower than in natural evergreen forests, but differed little from moist-deciduous forests. Plantations had 4%â€“9% higher average C capture rates (estimated using the Enhanced Vegetation Indexâ€“EVI) than natural forests during wet seasons, but up to 29% lower C capture during dry seasons across the 2000â€“18 period. In both seasons, the rate of C capture by plantations was less stable across years, and decreased more during drought years (i.e. lower resistance to drought), compared to forests. Thus, even as certain monodominant plantations could match natural forests for C capture and storage potential, plantations are unlikely to match the stabilityâ€“and hence reliabilityâ€“of C capture exhibited by forests, particularly in the face of increasing droughts and other climatic perturbations. Promoting natural forest regeneration and/or multi-species native tree plantations instead of plantation monocultures could therefore benefit climate change mitigation efforts, while offering valuable co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab5f75,2020,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Osuri, AM; Gopal, A; Raman, TRS; DeFries, R; Cook-Patton, SC; Naeem, S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying carbon stock from such ecosystems is very important in understanding the global carbon cycle. Geospatial technology plays an important role in this context, offers quick and accurate forest biomass carbon assessments at larger spatial scales. We combined remote sensing and field measured data for spatial mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock in varied vegetation types of northern part of Karnataka, India. Moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (250 m) satellite data was utilized in development of relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and field measured AGB and carbon stock. Field measured AGB ranged between 30.09 and 301.51 Mg ha−1 across different vegetation types.

The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.28 to 24.13 Mg C ha(-1). The average estimated carbon sequestration potential of the AFS, representing varying edapho-climatic conditions, on farmers field at country level was 0.21 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1).

,,,A1286,39,1287,Quantifying carbon stocks in shifting cultivation landscapes under divergent management scenarios relevant to REDD,"Shifting cultivation dominates many tropical forest regions. It is expanding into old-growth forests, and fallow period duration is rapidly decreasing, limiting secondary forest recovery. Shifting cultivation is thus a major driver of carbon emissions through deforestation and forest degradation, and of biodiversity loss. The impacts of shifting cultivation on carbon stocks have rarely been quantified, and the potential for carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES), such as REDD+, to protect carbon in shifting cultivation landscapes is unknown. We present empirical data on aboveground carbon stocks in old-growth forest and shifting cultivation landscapes in northeast India, a hotspot of threatened biodiversity. We then model landscape-level carbon stocks under business-as-usual scenarios, via expansion into the old-growth forest or decreasing fallow periods, and intervention scenarios in which REDD+ is used to either reduce deforestation of primary or secondary forest or increase fallow period duration. We found substantial recovery of carbon stocks as secondary forest regenerates, with a 30-yr fallow storing about one-half the carbon of an old-growth forest. Business-as-usual scenarios led to substantial carbon loss, with an 80% reduction following conversion of old-growth forest to a 30-yr shifting cultivation cycle and, relative to a 30-yr cultivation landscape, a 70% reduction when switching to a 5-yr cultivation cycle. Sparing old-growth forests from deforestation using protected areas and intensifying cropping in the remaining area of shifting cultivation is the most optimal strategy for carbon storage. In areas lacking old-growth forest, substantial carbon stocks accumulate over time by sparing fallows for permanent forest regeneration. Successful implementation of REDD+ in shifting cultivation landscapes can help avert global climate change by protecting forest carbon, with likely co-benefits for biodiversity.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1764,2018,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Borah, JR; Evans, KL; Edwards, DP",,,Tea cultivation; Deforestation; Population growth; Urbanization,PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA; COVER CHANGE; FOREST CONVERSION; DEFORESTATION; IMPACT; AGRICULTURE; VEGETATION; PROXIMATE; DYNAMICS; MALAYSIA,Polish Academy of Sciences,"[Prokop, Pawel] Polish Acad Sci, Dept Geoenvironm Res, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Jana 22, PL-31018 Krakow, Poland","Prokop, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Dept Geoenvironm Res, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Jana 22, PL-31018 Krakow, Poland.",National Science Centre (Poland) [2012/05/B/ST10/00309]; Indian National Science Academy,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive field data were collected to characterize forest vegetation parameters in the plots. Ground inventory data such as GBH, tree height were collected. The above ground tree biomass (ABG) is estimated from the collected ground data using the existing allometric equations at stand level in study area. Dual polarized ENVISAT C-band Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of IS2 beam mode i.e., incidence angle ranges from 18.8(0)-26.1(0) were analyzed. The DN values of the ENVISAT-ASAR data are converted to backscattering coefficients. The forest in the study area holds 129-203 Mg ha(-1) (1 Mg=10(3) kg) of Biomass. Scatter plots were drawn between backscattering coefficients and Volume, Basal Area and Biomass for VV, VH and HV polarizations. Results show that with increase in the biomass levels, backscattering coefficient also increases. The backscattering coefficient of HH has significant correlation with the biophysical parameters whereas VH and VV are not well correlated. This relationship can be utilized to estimate the forest biophysical parameters of the study area.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.693304,2006,MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND ENVIRONMENT V,"Jha, CS; Rangaswamy, M; Vyjayanthi, N; Murthy, MSR",,,microwave remote sensing; SAR interferometry; interferometric coherence; the canopy digital surface model; envisat- ASAR,,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)","[Kumar, Praveen; Krishna, A.

Present study demonstrates the use of high resolution IRS1C data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with supervised classification to define different types of forest cover in protected and unprotected areas for growing forest stock assessment of Shorea robusta Gaertn. F. (Sal) dominated forest. Further, a map of the same was generated which was subsequently validated using phyto-sociological field data in Dehradun, India. Three forest canopy density classes, viz., 10-30%, 30-70% and >70% could be differentiated. Aim of this study was to test usefulness of LISS-III and test its efficacy for assessment of total growing stock and further in generalising the method for the whole area. The homogeneous forest strata were field inventoried for individual tree (>= 10 cm dbh) diameter using sample quadrats at each of the study sites. The plot inventory data was analysed to arrive at image level growing stock estimates. An inspection review was carried out to be familiar with the study area using hard copy of LISS-III data to correlate the image. A scheme of forest classification was developed and the forests were stratified into moist Siwalik sal forest (3C/C2a), dry Siwalik sal forest (5B/C1a) and non-forest. High level of accuracy was achieved by ground truthing. The objective of the stratification was to categorize the forest into homogeneous strata. The biomass measurement from same sample plots was also integrated into the remote sensing technique for large spatial information on AGB distribution. The study revealed that protected sal forest has maximum volume and growing stock per hectare followed by unprotected sal forest. Same was also true for sal associates. The study also shows good scope of high resolution data for growing stock and forest carbon assessment, opening scope in estimating carbon sequestration potential of forest which may help researchers and policy makers to understand global and regional CO2 cycle.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2325115,2018,"REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX","Srivastava, P; Birman, S; Pandey, S",,,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; BIOLOGICAL AEROSOL-PARTICLES; NATURAL AMAZONIAN AEROSOL; HIGH-ALTITUDE SITE; ORGANIC AEROSOLS; FUNGAL SPORES; PARTICULATE MATTER; AIRBORNE BACTERIA; ISOMER-RATIOS; SOUTH-ASIA,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"[Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun] IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun] IIT Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn CESE, Atmospher Particle Technol Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India","Chauhan, AS (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Chauhan, AS (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn CESE, Atmospher Particle Technol Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2257,48,2258,The rain-runoff response of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation in the Western Ghats of India,"The effects of forest degradation and use and establishment of tree-plantations on degraded or modified forest ecosystems at multi-decadal time-scales using tree-plantations on the streamflow response are less studied in the humid tropics when compared to deforestation and forest conversion to agriculture. In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity-duration-frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23 ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i.e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall-streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36 min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2-3 year period (2003-2005) were analysed. In both the Coastal and Up-Ghat basins, the double mass curves showed during the rainy season a consistent trend in favour of more proportion of streamflow in the rank order DF > AC > NF. These double mass curves provide strong evidence that overland flow is progressively becomes a more dominant stormflow pathway. Across all sites. NF converted 28.4 +/- 6.41(stdev%) a of rainfall into total streamflow in comparison to 32.7 +/- 6.97(stdev%) in AC and 45.3 +/- 9.61(stdev%) in DF. Further support for the above trends emerges from the quickflow ratio Q(F)/Q for the Coastal basins. There are much higher values for both the DF and AC land covers, and their rank order DF > AC > NF. The quickflow response ratio Q(F)/P is also the highest for the DF basin, and along with the Q(F)/Q ratio, can exceed 90%. The corresponding delayed flow response ratios. Q(D)/P clearly show the largest Q(D) yields as a proportion of event precipitation from the Forest (NF1). The application of linear model supported these differences (e.g. 10-36% difference between NF and DF, p < 0.001) in the storm hydrologic response of the Coastal basins. The exception was Q(F)/P where there was a higher uncertainty connected with inter-basin mean differences. Cross-correlation plots for rain-streamflow and corresponding lag regression models for three storm events in the Coastal basins suggested the existence of alternative stormflow pathways with multiple lags with peaks between similar to 12 and 24 h in NF, compared to respective bimodal peaks at similar to 1 and 16 h in AC and similar to 1 and 12 h in DF. The long time lags for NF are suggestive of deep subsurface stormflow and groundwater as the contributing sources to the storm hydrograph. The short time lags in DF and AC are indicative of overland flow and so 'memory' of the previous degraded land cover is retained in AC as supported by previous hydraulic conductivity data. As potential and actual evapotranspiration is likely to be depressed during the monsoon, differences in streamflow and run-off responses between land-cover types is largely attributed to differences in soil infiltration and hydrologic pathways. Enhancing infiltration and reducing run-off in managed ecosystems should be explored in the terms of the context of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324. to 733 trees ha(-1), basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 m(2)-ha(-1) and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests.

,,,A1709,51,1710,Forest observational studies: an alternative to designed experiments,"With Ernst Assmann's appointment to the chair of Forest Yield Science in Munich in 1951, he assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the extensive network of growth-and-yield plots of the Bavarian Forest Research Institute. This network, with some plots having been remeasured since 1870, proved to be a rich source of observations, and constituted the empirical basis for Assmann's fundamental theories in production ecology. Realizing the strategic value of long-term field observations, scientists are using ( a) designed experiments and ( b) observational studies to study forest structure and dynamics. This contribution is an attempt to clarify fundamental differences, and to present examples, of these two approaches. We present recent developments regarding the installation of Designed Experiments and show that rigorous experimental design, usually found in planted forests and based on very specific manipulations, that are normally not found in the natural environment is required to address a particular hypothesis that cannot be tested by merely using available observations. We also present examples of new Forest Observational Networks established in China, India, Africa and America. These alternative research infrastructures are especially suitable for the study of natural forests that exhibit a high diversity of tree species with varying size and age structures. Our conclusion is that Forest Observational Studies are emerging as an important alternative to Designed Experiments because they provide a vast amount of information about complex natural forest communities rather quickly. However, long-term commitment is essential to ensure a steady flow of observations about forest dynamics. Manipulated experiments and observational studies can be complementary, but the optimum use of both installations requires careful planning and coordination.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-016-0952-0,2016,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,"von Gadow, K; Zhao, XH; Tewari, VP; Zhang, CY; Kumar, A; Rivas, JJC; Kumar, R",,,ALOS PALSAR; Landsat TM; polarization; backscatter; tropical deciduous forest; biomass; Munger; Bihar,ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SAR; LIDAR,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Space Applications Centre (SAC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India","[Sinha, Suman; Jeganathan, C.] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India; [Sharma, L.

Location Goa state is located between 15degrees48' N and 14degrees53'54'' N and 74degrees20'13'' E and 73degrees40'33'' E, in the northern part of the Western Ghats, India. Method A list of endemic plants from the study area was prepared using available floristic works and checklists of endemic plants of India. Based on preliminary field observations carried out in the study area, major habitats such as plateaus, moist deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, evergreen forests and mangroves were identified for the subsequent intensive survey of endemics. Voucher specimens for all the endemic species were collected, processed using conventional herbarium techniques and deposited in the Herbarium, Department of Botany, Goa University. Species were identified using local and regional floras and their identity was confirmed at various herbaria along the Western Ghats. Data on their life-form types, habitat and phenology was recorded in the field. Phenological observations were made every fortnight. A computerized data base was generated incorporating details on their life-form type, phenology and habitat. Results A floristic survey of endemic plants of the Western Ghats in Goa resulted in the collection of 113 endemic species. Life-form analysis reveals that herbaceous endemics are the most dominant followed by trees, shrubs and climbers. Plateaus in the study area harbour the largest number of endemic species, especially herbs. Endemic trees are distributed in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. Endemic species in the study area show different peak and lean seasons of flowering depending on their life-form type, habitat and ecological factors like temperature and rainfall/moisture content in the soil. Main conclusions The plateaus in the northern part of the Western Ghats are unique, being species rich with herbaceous endemics. These ephemerals are closely associated with the rainfall patterns thus; any change of moisture regime over the long-term will have an impact on the distribution of these endemics.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01067.x,2004,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Joshi, VC; Janarthanam, MK",,,disturbance; microbial biomass; soil nutrient pool; tropical wet-evergreen forest; northeast India,SUBTROPICAL HUMID FOREST; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; EXTRACTION METHOD; PLANT NUTRIENTS; PHOSPHORUS; RESPIRATION; GLUCOSE; CARBON,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology (NERIST); North Eastern Hill University,"North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Restorat Ecol Lab, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India; North Eastern Hill Univ, Dept Bot, Meghalaya 793022, India","Arunachalam, K (corresponding author), North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Restorat Ecol Lab, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Stratified random sampling of tree species was done by placing minimum 15 quadrats of 10 x 10 m at each aspect and altitude. The results reveal that along the altitudinal gradient there were three types of forest communities in the Sanctuary viz., chir pine (Pinus roxburghii), oakchir pine (Quercus leucotrichophora and Pinus roxburghii) and oak (Quercus floribunda and Quercus leucotrichophora). Rhododendron arboreum, Cornus macrophylla and Lyonia ovalifolia were main associates of these forest communities. The oak forests had larger shrub population as compared to chir pine. Myrsine africana was the most dominant shrub across the altitudinal gradient, whereas few shrub species were restricted to a certain altitudinal range. The regeneration of chir pine was best at lower altitude on south and east aspects, which indicates that it mostly regenerates on warm and dry slopes. In general, the regeneration potential in most of the tree species declines with the altitude. The density of saplings and seedlings also represented the dominant species at each altitudinal range, which indicates the cyclic regeneration of forests in the Sanctuary area.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1134/S1067413610010157,2010,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Majila, BS; Kala, CP",,,Development; gender; institutions; particular and general interests; resource management; structure,COMMUNITY; GENDER,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Arora-Jonsson, S (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,,,,,

The mean annual dry weight of P kesiya fine roots did not vary significantly between the stands, but the coarse root mass increased significantly from the 6- to 23-year-old stand. However, herbaceous fine roots and rhizomes showed a reverse trend. Live roots (biomass) showed a higher N and P concentration than the necromass (dead root mass). Nutrient concentrations were greater in the fine roots compared to coarse roots. N and P accumulation was maximum in the 6-year-old stand and minimum in the 15-year-old stand. P. kesiya fine roots decomposed in a three-phased manner in all the stands. The first phase, lasting about 30 days, was characterised by a slow rate of weight loss. This was followed by a rapid phase of weight loss up to 90 days, with an average weight loss of 7.7 mg day(-1), and the third phase showed a slow decay pattern (1.2 mg day(-1)).

,,,A2734,58,2735,Ecosystem impacts of disturbance in a dry tropical forest in southern India,"Indian forests provide a multitude of services to vast populations. Common human activities including livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction and burning have the potential to impact forest ecosystem structure and function. The effects of these activities on vegetation, ecology and soil properties were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in southern India. Data were collected from 200 sites in four watersheds within the park. Sample sites spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). This paper focusses on the impacts on vegetation structure, diversity and composition, and integrates impacts on soil. Shrub and tree species were inventoried and evaluated in plots 10-m in diameter. The tree layer was dominated by Anogeissus-Emblica-Tectona species. The understory was dominated by invasives Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara, and native gymnosporia emarginata. Vegetation plot heights, canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance resulting in stunted forest stature in degraded sites. Vegetation composition in degraded watersheds was dominated by small woody tree species and a greater diversity of shrub species. Ordination analysis was used to integrate soil data with vegetation and disturbance, revealing that deciduous forest in the park is degrading to scrub forest along with negative impacts on soil characteristics. Consequences of services currently enjoyed by local populations are discussed.

This study assessed the effect of continuous N and P additions for 6 years on the size distribution and properties of soil aggregates in forest-ecotone-savanna gradient. Addition of N significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates in forest and ecotone, whereas the same input significantly decreased their proportion in the savanna. Consequently, the stability of soil aggregates increased significantly in forest and ecotone, whereas it decreased significantly in the savanna. The effect of P addition on soil aggregate stability was marginal. N addition also altered the biological and chemical qualities of soil aggregates. It caused increase in microbial biomass C (MBC) associated with macroaggregates in forest and ecotone; however, in savanna, MBC increased in the microaggregates. P addition did not affect the amount of MBC in both types of soil aggregates. Because of rapid accumulation of applied N and P in the microbial biomass, the ratios of MBC to microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) as well as microbial biomass phosphorous (MBP) were decreased in both aggregates. Overall, the effect of N addition was more marked than that of P addition, suggesting that N is more limiting than P in these dry tropical ecosystems. In the current scenario of N loading, continued soil N loading in forest may lead to increased macroaggregates with associated MBC and MBN and greater aggregate stability. In contrast, the extensively distributed savannas may show the reverse trend leading to a decrease in soil fertility.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01702.x,2008,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Tripathi, SK; Kushwaha, CP; Singh, KP",,,secondary succession; secondary tree species; pioneer shrubs; grazing; usufruct benefits; common property resources; India,COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES; DRY EVERGREEN FORESTS; DIVERSITY; GRASSLANDS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; RAINFALL; SAVANNA,Pondicherry University,"[Kinhal, Vijayalaxmi; Parthasarathy, N.] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Puducherry 605014, India","Kinhal, V (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Puducherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1116,61,1117,"Plant diversity of the Kangchenjunga Landscape, Eastern Himalayas","The Kangchenjunga Landscape (KL) in the Eastern Himalayas is a transboundary complex shared by Bhutan, India, and Nepal. It forms a part of the 'Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot' and is one of the biologically richest landscapes in the Eastern Himalayas. In this paper, we use secondary information to review and consolidate the knowledge on the flora of the KL. We reviewed 215 journal articles, analysed the history of publications on the flora of the KL, their publication pattern in terms of temporal and spatial distribution and key research areas. Our review shows that the landscape has a long history of botanical research that dates back to the 1840s and progressed remarkably after the 1980s. Most of the studies have been carried out in India, followed by Nepal and Bhutan. The majority of these have been vegetation surveys, followed by research on ethnobotanical aspects and Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). This paper describes the forest types and characteristic species of the KL and details the species richness, diversity and dominant families of seed plants. A total of 5198 species of seed plants belonging to 1548 genera and 216 families have been recorded from the landscape, including 3860 dicots, 1315 monocots and 23 gymnosperms. Among families, Orchidaceae is the most diversely represented family in terms of species richness. This paper also draws attention to the threatened and endemic flora of the KL, including 44 species that are threatened at national and global level and 182 species that are endemic. Finally, the paper reviews the major challenges facing the KL, the conservation efforts and practices that are currently in place and recommends systematic and comprehensive floral surveys, particularly long-term data collection and monitoring and transboundary collaboration, to address the existing knowledge gaps on floral diversity of the KL.

In this context, the relationship between biodiversity (especially plant diversity) and soil carbon (C) sequestration (as a means of mitigating global warming) has become a subject of considerable scientific interest. This relationship was tested for homegardens (HG), a popular and sustainable agroforestry system in the tropics, in Thrissur district, Kerala, India. The major objectives were to examine how tree density and plant-stand characteristics of homegardens affect soil C sequestration. Soil samples were collected at four depths (0-20, 20-50, 50-80, 80-100 cm) from HG of varying sizes and age classes, and their total C content determined. Tree density and plant-stand characteristics such as species richness (Margalef Index) and diversity (Shannon Index) of the HG were also determined. Results indicated that the soil C stock was directly related to plant diversity of HG. Homegardens with higher, compared to those with lower, number of plant species, as well as higher species richness and tree density had higher soil carbon, especially in the top 50 cm of soil. Overall, within 1 m profile, soil C content ranged from 101.5 to 127.4 Mg ha(-1). Smaller-sized HG (< 0.4 ha) that had higher tree density and plant-species density had more soil C per unit area (119.3 Mg ha(-1)) of land than larger-sized ones (> 0.4 ha) (108.2 Mg ha(-1)). Soil C content, especially below 50 cm, was higher in older gardens. The enhanced soil-C storage in species-rich homegardens could have relevance and applications in broader ecological contexts.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9228-8,2009,AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS,"Saha, SK; Nair, PKR; Nair, VD; Kumar, BM",,,Agroforestry systems; Light regimes; Intercrops; Multipurpose trees; Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Mycorrhizal colonization,SUB-TROPICAL PLANTS; LIGHT-INTENSITY; SOIL-TEMPERATURE; INFECTION; EFFICACY,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Agroforestry Research Institute,"[Shukla, Ashok; Kumar, Anil; Jha, Anuradha; Chaturvedi, Om Prakash; Prasad, Rajendra; Gupta, Ajit] Natl Res Ctr Agroforestry, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India","Shukla, A (corresponding author), Natl Res Ctr Agroforestry, Near Pahuj Dam,Gwalior Rd, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A0609,68,610,Patterns and driving factors of biomass carbon and soil organic carbon stock in the Indian Himalayan region,"ree-based ecosystems are critical to climate change mitigation. The study analysed carbon (C) stock patterns and examined the importance of environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). We conducted a synthesis of 100 studies reporting biomass carbon stock and 67 studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from four land-uses: forests, plantation, agroforest, and herbaceous ecosystem from the IHR. Machine learning techniques were used to examine the importance of various environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils. Despite large variations in biomass C and SOC stock (mean ± SD) within the land-uses, natural forests have the highest biomass C stock (138.5 ± 87.3 Mg C ha−1), and plantation forests exhibited the highest SOC stock (168.8 ± 74.4 Mg C ha−1) in the top 1-m of soils. The relationship between the environmental variables (altitude, latitude, precipitation, and temperature) and carbon stock was not significantly correlated. The prediction of biomass carbon and SOC stock using different machine learning techniques (Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, and XGBoost) shows that the XGBoost model can predict the carbon stock for the IHR closely. Our study confirms that the carbon stock in the IHR vary on a large scale due to a diverse range of land-use and ecosystems within the region. Therefore, predicting the driver of carbon stock on a single environmental variable is impossible for the entire IHR. The IHR possesses a prominent carbon sink and biodiversity pool. Therefore, its protection is essential in fulfilling India's commitment to nationally determined contributions (NDC). Our data synthesis may also provide a baseline for the precise estimation of carbon stock, which will be vital for India's National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE).",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145292,2021,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Ahirwal, J; Nath, A; Brahma, B; Deb, S; Sahoo, UK; Nath, AJ",,,Jackfruit; Antioxidant property; Phenolics; DPPH,WESTERN-GHATS; 2 FORMS; JACKFRUIT; FRUIT; LECTIN; L.; BINDING; SELECTIONS; DIVERSITY; CULTIVAR,University of Kerala; University of Kerala; KSCSTE-Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden & Research Institute (JNTBGRI); University of Kerala,"[Sreeja Devi, P.

A total of 300 home gardens were selected randomly from 11 districts of North-East India. Hill numbers were used to analyse sample completeness, size-based diversity and coverage-based diversity. Canonical correspondence analysis, Pearson’s correlation, stepwise multiple linear regression, Poisson log-linear model and linear mixed effect model were performed to study the interactions between species diversity and site quality. In total, 137 species belonging to 102 genera and 46 families were recorded from the 300 home gardens. Fabaceae was the dominant family, and Parkia timoriana (DC.) Merr.

The effect of the thicket-forming habit of L. camara as a dispersal and recruitment barrier in a community of native woody seedlings was examined in a 50-ha permanent plot located in the seasonally dry forest of Mudumalai, southern India. Sixty 100-m2 plots were enumerated for native woody seedlings between 10–100 cm in height. Of these, 30 plots had no L. camara thickets, while the other 30 had dense thickets. The frequency of occurrence and abundance of seedlings were modelled as a function of dispersal mode (mammal, bird or mechanical) and affinities to forest habitats (dry forest, moist forest or ubiquitous) as well as presence or absence of dense L. camara thickets. Furthermore, frequency of occurrence and abundance of individual species were also compared between thickets and no L. camara. At the community level, L. camara density, dispersal mode and forest habitat affinities of species determined both frequency of occurrence and abundance of seedlings, with the abundance of dry-forest mammal-dispersed species and ubiquitous mechanically dispersed species being significantly lower under L. camara thickets. Phyllanthus emblica and Kydia calycina were found to be significantly less abundant under L. camara, whereas most other species were not affected by the presence of thickets. It was inferred that, by affecting the establishment of native tree seedlings, L. camara thickets could eventually alter the community composition of such forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2011,NA,"G Ramaswami, R Sukumar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But is especially a cause of concern for tropical countries which are urbanizing much faster and with relatively less urban planning than temperate ones. Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on allocating green spaces within urban settings and expand the formal green spaces. Existing green spaces could be improved by augmenting compositional and structural heterogeneity of vegetation as well as conservation of large old native trees.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-021-01165-9,2022,URBAN ECOSYSTEMS,"Kaushik, M; Tiwari, S; Manisha, K",,,Bikaner-Nagaur Basin; Stable carbon isotope; Mangroves; Palaeohydrological proxies; Relative hydrocarbon potential; Palaeoredox factor,WESTERN INDIA; DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT; THERMAL MATURITY; N-ALKANES; LIGNITE DEPOSITS; EASTERN ALPS; KUTCH BASIN; GEOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; TRITERPENOID HYDROCARBONS; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad; Rajasthan Technical University; Department of Science & Technology (India); Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP),"[Kumar, Dinesh; Ghosh, Santanu; Tiwari, Balram; Varma, Atul Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Indian Sch Mines, Dept Appl Geol, Coal Geol & Organ Petrol Lab, Dhanbad 826004, Jharkhand, India; [Kumar, Dinesh] Rajasthan Tech Univ, Univ Dept, Petr Engn Branch, Kota 324010, Rajasthan, India; [Mathews, Runcie Paul; Chetia, Rimpy] DST Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Varma, AK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Indian Sch Mines, Dept Appl Geol, Coal Geol & Organ Petrol Lab, Dhanbad 826004, Jharkhand, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Lantana camara typically dominates the understorey in. invaded areas and might therefore reduce the availability of resources and microhabitats essential for butterflies. We hypothesized that butterflies would show reduced use of lantana-dominated habitat when compared with native vegetation. We evaluated such reduced habitat use by testing for (1) reduced levels of behaviours other than feeding and (2) fewer butterfly species and individuals in lantana-dominated habitat patches. To test these expectations, three plots of 30 x 30 meters each were laid in lantana-dominated and native-vegetation patches. In total, three plots in native-vegetation and three in lantana-dominated habitat were marked. Butterfly behaviour was measured through focal-animal follows, and abundance and species numbers were investigated using point sampling inside these plots. We found that butterflies showed substantial behavioural differences between lantana-dominated and native-vegetation plots, indicating a possiblity that the invaded patches were relatively less suitable for several butterfly activities. Furthermore, fewer butterfly species and individuals were seen in lantana-dominated compared with native-vegetation habitat, indicating that lantana invasion results in reduced suitability of a habitat. Whether local behavioural effects of invasive plants, such as reduced habitat use, can lead ultimately to reduced population sizes and local extinctions will need to be examined.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.18473/lepi.70i4.a9,2016,JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY,"Jambhekar, RM; Isvaran, K",,,Anthropogenic disturbances; population structure; regeneration status; seedling survival; western Himalaya,POPULATION-STRUCTURE; SUBTROPICAL FORESTS; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITIES; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; ASSOCIATIONS; PATTERNS; ALTITUDE; VALLEY,Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University,"[Malik, Zubair A.; Bhatt, A.

Yet we know little about greenery in the context of urban poverty, particularly in slums, which constitute a significant challenge for inclusive development in many rapidly growing cities. We assessed the composition, density, diversity, and species distribution of vegetation in 44 slums of Bangalore, India, comparing these to published studies on vegetation diversity in other land-use categories. Most trees were native to the region, as compared to other land-use categories such as parks and streets which are dominated by introduced species. Of the most frequently encountered tree species, Moringa oleifera and Cocos nucifera are important for food, while Ficus religiosa plays a critical cultural and religious role. Tree density and diversity were much lower in slums compared to richer residential neighborhoods. There are also differences in species preferences, with most plant (herb, shrub and vines) species in slums having economic, food, medicinal, or cultural use, while the species planted in richer residential areas are largely ornamental. Historic development has had an impact on species distribution, with older slums having larger sized tree species, while recent slums were dominated by smaller sized tree species with greater economic and food use. Extensive focus on planting trees and plant species with utility value is required in these congested neighborhoods, to provide livelihood support.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-015-0467-3,2015,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Gopal, D; Nagendra, H; Manthey, M",,,Carbon budget; Carbon sequestration; Dipterocarpus; Biomass; Net production,TROPICAL FORESTS; BIOMASS,Manipur University,"[Devi, L.

This study assessed the quantitative and qualitative status of plant community richness and diversity in areas invaded by L. camara in the Siwalik Hills (Himachal Pradesh, India), and explored allelopathy as a possible mechanism of interference. We measured species diversity, richness and evenness of the vegetation in areas invaded and uninvaded by L. camara. Allelopathic effects of L. camara rhizosphere soil and litter were assessed against two native plants-Achyranthes aspera (a herb) and Albizia lebbeck (a tree). Density, biomass and indices of diversity, richness and evenness were reduced by L. camara, indicating a significant alteration in composition and structure of native communities. Seedling growth of the test species was reduced in L. camara rhizosphere- and litter-amended soil. The inhibitory effect was ameliorated by the addition of activated charcoal, indicating the presence of organic inhibitors (quantified as phenolics) in the soil. Lantana invasion greatly reduces the density and diversity of the vegetation in the invaded area, and chemical interference of its litter plays an important role in invasion.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3624-x,2014,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Singh, HP; Batish, DR; Dogra, KS; Kaur, S; Kohli, RK; Negi, A",,,bamboo; calorific value; ash; burning profile; Thermogravimetric analysis,CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; CARBONIZATION,Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Institute of Wood Science & Technology (IWST),"[Kumar, Ritesh; Chandrashekar, N.] Inst Wood Sci & Technol, Bangalore 560003, Karnataka, India","Kumar, R (corresponding author), Inst Wood Sci & Technol, 18th Cross, Bangalore 560003, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

The natural vegetation types had relatively high diversities compared to human impacted vegetation types such as scrub/savanna and grasslands. The home gardens and paddy fields had very distinctive species composition, coupled with very low levels of beta diversity. Their constituent species were more widespread. Comparison of these patterns with those found amongst trees and birds reported in similar studies threw up interesting parallels as well as contrasts. Species dissimilarity in evergreen vegetation types was high for trees and butterflies, but low for birds. Bird and butterfly assemblages in monoculture tree plantations had low species richness, less distinctiveness and high levels of dissimilarity, being comprised of rather widespread species. However, on the whole there was little relation between taxonomic groups and vegetation types across diversity parameters, There could be important implications of these patterns of diversity dispersion and their co-variation across taxonomic groups for assigning conservation priorities.

Trees >= 30 cm girth at breast height were inventoried in four 1 ha plots in selectively logged patches and two 1 ha plots in an adjacent unlogged patch of lowland dipterocarp forest continuum, Uppangala, central Western Ghats, India. We enumerated 2343 trees (598 trees ha(-1)) belonging to 116 species (63 species ha(-1)) and 1345 trees (672 trees ha(-1)) belonging to 68 species (55 species ha(-1)) in logged and unlogged plots, respectively. The species richness in logged plots as compared to unlogged plots varied with spatial scale of sampling: at 1 ha scale two logged plots had higher species richness whereas it was high in only one plot at 400 m(2) scale. Logged plots had low floristic similarity between them and also with the unlogged plots. Mantel and partial Mantel tests proved that logging was the main driver for the species composition rather than the elevation and spatial distance. Higher abundance of species belonging to canopy, intermediate and light wood categories and lower density of emergent, understory and medium wood types were recorded in the logged plots. As compared to unlogged plots, logged plots had 20-59% less above ground biomass (AGB) due to paucity of larger trees, especially in the emergent and medium wood types but higher AGB in canopy and hardwood categories.

Correspondence analysis (CA) and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of plots by species abundances data showed similar arching patterns, with significant correlation between the first axis of CA and NMDS (r=0.77). Hierarchical clustering of plot scores along the three first CA axes resulted in splitting the plots into five different categories that broadly reflect the major bioclimatic features of the region. A multiscale bootstrapping test indicated that categorization of the wettest (wet evergreen group 1 and 2) and driest (dry deciduous) groups were robust (P < 0.05 with 1000 bootstraps), while the remaining two transitional groups were uncertain (P=0.12 and 0.26 for moist deciduous and semi-evergreen group, respectively). Principal component analysis revealed that plots with similar floristic composition can encompass contrastingly different physiognomic structures (canopy cover, canopy height and mean tree diameter) probably in relation to their levels of disturbance.

We classified fire-affected areas into high, medium, low, and no-fire frequency classes based On government records. Tree species were unevenly distributed across fire frequency categories. Shrub density was maximum in zones of high fire frequency and minimum in low-frequency and no-fire zones. Lower tree density after fires indicated that regeneration of seedlings was reduced by fire. The population structure in the high-frequency zone was comprised of seedlings of size class (A) and saplings of size class (B), represented by Diospyros melanoxylon, Dalbergia sissoo, Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis. Younger and older trees were more abundant for Tectona grandis and Dalbargia sissoo after fire, whereas intermediate-aged trees were more abundant pre-fire, indicating that the latter age-class was thinned by the catastrophic effect of fire. The major contributing components of fuel load included duff litter and small woody branches and twigs on the forest floor. Total fuel load on the forest floor ranged from 2.2 to 3.38 Mg/ha. The net change in fuel load was positive in high- and medium-frequency fire zones and negative under low- and no-fire zones. Repeated fires, however, slowly reduced stand stability. An ecological approach is needed for fire management to restore the no-fire spatial and temporal structure of moist deciduous forests, their species composition and fuel loads.

In India, which hosts a high density and diversity of CCAs, the need for more assessments of the ecological and socio-economic properties of these systems to guide conservation planning and policy has been emphasised in recent years. We inventoried the extant sacred grove network against official records of 407 groves across 70 villages in the Kodagu District of India's Western Ghats, and interviewed local communities about their management and conservation. We also evaluated recent trends in aboveground biomass of sacred groves using time-series satellite data from six time-points during the 2000-2010 period, and made comparisons to corresponding trends in nearby State-managed protected forests. Although most of the larger (>2 ha) groves officially listed were forested at present, over two-thirds of the smaller groves listed were either not forested or could not be located. Local communities attributed these declines to encroachment and illicit logging. Time-series satellite data revealed aboveground biomass declines of similar to 0.5% annually across the sacred grove network over the 2000-2010 period. In contrast, biomass increased during this period at the interiors and edges of State-managed forests in the landscape. Our results highlight that the conservation status of even well-protected CCAs can vary considerably over time, especially given the dynamism in socio-economic, cultural and ecological factors that govern their status. We argue that understanding and addressing this dynamism is crucial to the conservation of CCAs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,A2539,85,2540,Comparative efficiency and accuracy of variable area transects versus square plots for sampling tree diversity and density,"Agroforestry systems have been recognized as areas with high conservation potential, and there is a need to quickly assess the biodiversity and tree stocking density available in these systems. However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect 9-12% at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (-5 to -7% at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9255-5,2010,AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS,"Nath, CD; Pelissier, R; Garcia, C",,,community composition; grass; herbivory; large-carnivore conservation; species richness; tree seedling; ungulate; tiger habitat,LANTANA-CAMARA L.; SEEDLING SURVIVAL; DECIDUOUS FOREST; TREE; ECOSYSTEM; GROWTH; EDGE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; SHADE,,"[Prasad, Ayesha E.] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India","Prasad, AE (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",Save the Tiger Fund (NFWF) (U.S.A.); Rufford Foundation for Nature Conservation (U.K.),,,,,,,,,,

,,,A1212,87,1213,Assessment of eco-diversity status of Homalomena aromatica (Spreng.) Schott and its habitat in tropical forest of Indian Eastern Himalaya,"Homalomena aromatica (Spreng.) Schott is one of the economically important plant species occurring in the North east and Eastern Himalayan region of India which received least attention in its ecological and conservation studies. The current study has been undertaken in the north eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The population, phytosociological status of its habitat, regeneration and species association of H. aromatica were worked out using standard ecological methods. Out of the 15 selected forest sites for survey, H. aromatica was found only in 9 sites. A total of 288 species representing 99 families are documented from the selected sites where Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, Araceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Poaceae are found dominant in all the 9 sites. Species diversity index (H') of all the three habits i.e. the tree, shrub, and herb were found highest in Happy Valley site followed by Ganga Lake. A total of 219 individuals of H. aromatica recorded which were found confined within the altitudinal ranges of 350m-450m asl. The IVI (1.95 to 9.64) and Frequency % (5 to 12.5) range of H. aromatica found significantly low at all the survey sites. Pearson's correlation analysis reveals that there is a positive relationship between the population size and the species diversity index, where shrub showed the strongest relationship (r(7)=0.900, P=0.001) followed by tree r(7)=0.736, P=0.024 and the herbs with weakest relationship (r(7)=0.39, P=0.269). The Chi-square test of association indicated significant association of 10 species with H. aromatica in the various sites where Alocasia acuminate (Aracaceae), Amomum sp. (Zingiberaceae) and Pteris sp. (Pteridaceae) showed highest association with higher Chi square value. The poor population status with average density of 3041.67/hectare and 8.89 frequency percentage as well the existing anthropogenic threats to the species recorded in the present study has warrants for its immediate conservation.",y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.14719/pst.2019.6.2.435,2019,PLANT SCIENCE TODAY,"Ronald, K; Gajurel, PR; Singh, B",,,buried sites; catastrophic floods; geoarchaeology; geophysical exploration; ground-penetrating radar; India; Kaveri River,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE; RIVER; SEDIMENTS; ARCHITECTURE; SARASWATI; TEMPLES; TALAKAD; THICK; DAMS,Periyar University; Bharathidasan University; Central University of Tamil Nadu; Bharathidasan University; China University of Geosciences; University of Adelaide; Curtin University Sarawak; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale,"[Ramkumar, Mu.; Manikandan, E.; Prithiviraj, G.; Ayyanthurai, R.; Ramachandran, C.] Periyar Univ, Dept Geol, Salem 636011, India; [Kumaraswamy, K.; Rahaman, S.

The present study estimates the biomass and carbon stock of major tropical forest types in India, and attempts to identify suitable interpolation techniques for mapping carbon stock. Empirically derived allometric equations and carbon conversion coefficients were used to estimate the aboveground biomass and carbon stock, respectively. The point estimates were interpolated to spatial surface using different interpolation techniques. Two main modelling approaches were implemented: deterministic modelling and stochastic modelling. Deterministic modelling was to interpolate point information using similarities between measured points (inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation), and fitting a smoothing curve along the measured points (polynomial interpolation). In stochastic modelling, ordinary kriging (OK) was employed using parameters derived from semivariograms. The results showed that the average carbon stock in the study area was 84t/ha. The highest carbon stock was in evergreen forest and the lowest in thorny scrub forest. Validation of the model using the mean and RMS errors indicated that ordinary kriging performs better than IDW and polynomial interpolations.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2010.516107,2010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,"Joseph, S; Reddy, CS; Thomas, AP; Srivastava, SK; Srivastava, VK",,,conservation status; community dependence; hydropower potential; forest type; environmental impacts; submergence zone; Western Himalaya,CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; FORESTS; MOUNTAINS; TANZANIA; PLANT,G.B.

We examine tree diversity and composition in sacred sites in Bengaluru, one of India's fastest growing cities. We recorded 5504 trees from 93 species across 62 temples, churches, and Hindu, Christian and Muslim cemeteries in central areas of Bengaluru. Over half (52%) of the tree species were of native origin, a much higher proportion when compared to other green spaces in the city such as parks. Tree density in sacred sites was much higher than that in parks and informal settlements in Bengaluru. Temples and Hindu cemeteries contained the highest proportion of native species, with large numbers of Ficus benghalensis, a keystone sacred species. Trees in sacred spaces provide an important buffer against urban environmental stress in Indian cities, and serve as refuges for urban wildlife and biodiversity.

Disturbance resulted in considerable increase in air temperature and light intensity in the forest and decline in the soil nutrients concentration, which affected the growth of microbial populations and soil microbial biomass. There were significant correlations between bacterial and fungal populations and microbial biomass C, N and P. Soil microbial population was higher in the undisturbed (UD) forest stand than the disturbed forest stands during post-monsoon and less during rainy season due to heavy rainfall. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and therefore, low microbial biomass C, N and P. Microbial biomass was negatively correlated with soil temperature and pH in all the forest stands. However, there were significant positive relationships among microbial biomass C, N and P. Percentage contribution of microbial C to soil organic C was higher in UD forest, whereas percentage contribution of microbial biomass N and P to total N and total P was higher in the moderately disturbed site than in the highly disturbed (HD) site. These results reveal that the nutrient retention by soil microbial biomass was greater in the selective logged stand and would help in the regeneration of the forest upon protection. On the other hand, the cultivated site (HD) that had the lowest labile fractions of soil organic matter may recover at a slower phase. Further, minimum and maximum microbial biomass C, N and P during rainy and winter seasons suggest the synchronization between nutrient demand for plant growth and nutrient retention in microbial biomass that would help in ecosystem recovery following disturbance.

,,,A2319,92,2320,Fauna data integration and species distribution modelling as two major advantages of geoinformatics-based phytobiodiversity study in today's fast changing climate,"The development and growth of geospatial techniques offer many advantages and challenges to the study of biodiversity, especially in the present era of climate change. We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24% increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2,2012,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Matin, S; Chitale, VS; Behera, MD; Mishra, B; Roy, PS",,,Biodiversity characterization; landscape analysis; remote sensing; spatial database,IDENTIFICATION; MODEL,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Roy, P.

West coast of India host 29% of the mangrove ecosystems of the country. Putting aside the few scientific studies about the Indian mangroves system, there exist gaps in our scientific knowledge of Blue Carbon domain. This study aims to quantify the ecosystem carbon stocks potential and community structure of mangrove vegetation/ ecosystem species of Vypin– Cochin, a coastal region of the Southwest coast of India. The information on species-specific carbon storage will benefit to choose best species in the afforestation and conservation initiatives. Distribution, community structure and carbon pools of above and below ground biomass of the study area were assessed. From the analysis, it is evident that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves varies according to species, functional attributes (basal area, DBH, mean height etc.) and region. Avicennia officinalis, Rhizophora mucronata, Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Bruguiera cylindrica and Sonneratia caseolaris are the mangrove species observed from the study area. As per the community structure assessment, A. officinalis showed large number, frequency, density, and evenness. While considering biomass, R.mucronata species possess high value. The mean overall above ground biomass of the region was 69.55 ± 80.38 t ha−1. Ecosystem carbon stock of the area ranges from 17.7–138.8 with an average of 54.3 ± 36 t ha−1.

Measurement of canopy cover, light interception and disturbance index revealed that these two sacred forests are comparable with respect to plant diversity and community attributes. The disturbance index was slightly higher in Mairang sacred forests, which had supported high species richness, better recruitment of seedlings leading to high regeneration potential. This was due to formation of gaps within forest. On other hand, gaps facilitated expansion of crown of trees, which inhibited growth and survival of saplings, the retarded growth of saplings had resulted in low conversion of saplings to trees. This condition could also be a reason for high basal area and low tree density in Mairang sacred forest. Endemic, rare and rare endemics were also reported from both the forests. Altitude had impacted composition, and dominance of species and families. Both the forests were highly dissimilar with respect to species composition.

Unfortunately they are often undervalued due to lack of public awareness or resources. Analysis of species diversity and turnover at long-lived gardens can improve the understanding of long-term plant resilience and help adapt management actions to align with rapidly changing urban contexts. Given the various threats faced by urban botanical gardens, we examined tree species diversity, historical changes and survival of plants at the Botanical Garden in Pondicherry (BGP), southern India, which was established 192 years ago by the colonial French government. A complete census of trees was carried out to compare current species diversity with two historical lists compiled 151 years ago and 57 years ago, respectively. These lists were also used to identify heritage trees. Effects of environmental threats, including the very severe cyclonic storm Thane (December 2011) and various damages to young stems, were analysed with Google Earth images and field inventories. There were 284 identified tree species, including 25 endangered/vulnerable/threatened species and 53 tropical dry evergreen forest species. Turnover had occurred, and approximately half of the historical species had been replaced with new species. Tropical Cyclone Thane caused severe damage to large trees and anthropogenic activities damaged saplings. Yet, at least 65 large resilient individuals had survived all the threats, and signifiy the adaptability and heritage value of the BGP. Our study revealed multiple values of this heritage green space in a rapidly developing South Asian city and suggests strategies for modernisation that are aligned with international conservation guidelines.

LocationTropical evergreen forests, Western Ghats, South India. MethodsUsing a plot-based species inventory spanning the entire latitudinal extent (1,200km) of the Western Ghats' wet evergreen forests, we collected primary data on spatial variation in species composition of woody plants. Each plot was characterized by a set of environmental descriptors consisting of topographic, edaphic and climatic variables, while eigenvector-based spatial variables and plot coordinates were used as spatial descriptors. We used ordination-based as well as distance-based variation partitioning techniques to partition the variation in species composition into components uniquely and jointly explained by environmental and spatial factors. ResultsThe compositional similarity of woody plants largely showed a linear decline with log-geographic distance. However, this relationship was spatially structured. After controlling for the differences in environment, compositional similarity was found to be strongly associated with geographic distance only at the smallest spatial scale. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental variables explained a much larger proportion of variation in species composition overall compared to spatial variables. Among environmental variables, climatic variables emerged as the most important predictors of variation in species composition at regional and landscape scales. ConclusionsStrong association between compositional similarity and geographic distance at local scales indicates the influence of dispersal limitation, while niche differentiation seems to be a more important driver of variation in species composition at larger spatial scales. Overall, our results provide evidence for scale-dependent shifts in the relative importance of factors that are responsible for variation in species composition.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12586,2018,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Page, NV; Shanker, K",,,agroforestry; charcoal; ecological history; fossil pollen; India; mixed-modelling; tropical forest,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; LAND-USE; FOREST FRAGMENTS; SACRED GROVES; AGRICULTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; LEGACIES; SYSTEMS; RECORDS,"University of Southampton; University of Oxford; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Open University - UK; Open University - UK; University of Oxford; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier","[Nogue, Sandra] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Nogue, Sandra; Tovar, Carolina; Willis, Kathy J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Tovar, Carolina; Willis, Kathy J.] Kew, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, Dept Geog, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, Open Space Res Ctr, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Finsinger, Walter] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France","Nogue, S (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.;Nogue, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",Leverhulme Trust [F/08 773/E]; British Ecological Society; Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters through the VISTA programme [6158],"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Although they are identified primarily for spiritual or religious purposes, their contribution to biodiversity conservation has been widely debated. Sacred sites are known to harbour greater biodiversity compared to exploited forests, but the patterns are not well known. We studied tree diversity in a remote forested location in eastern India where sacred forests and reserve forests used by people are present. Tree data from eight sacred forest sites and nine reserve forest sites showed that species richness was significantly greater in sacred forests; species diversity and evenness tended to be greater, but these were not statistically significant. Basal area (a measure of aboveground biomass) was significantly greater, mainly due to the greater density of large trees. There were significant departures from the theoretical expectation of stem size density distributions under pure asymmetric competition for both land tenures, which indicated that extraneous mortality increased death rates of large trees under both regimes, but sacred forests had a greater range of stem sizes. Our results suggest that sacred forests can contribute to biodiversity conservation by preserving greater tree diversity than forests subject to human use.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892919000390,2020,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Rath, S; Banerjee, S; John, R",,,Mycobacterium tuberculosis; India; Spoligotype; Strain diversity,GENETIC DIVERSITY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; MIRU-VNTR; STRAINS; DELHI; LINEAGES; POLYMORPHISM,Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT); University of Cambridge,"[Poonawala, Husain] Natl Inst Res TB, 1 Mayor Sathyamoorthy Rd, Chennai 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Poonawala, Husain] Inst Publ Hlth, Bangalore 560070, Karnataka, India; [Kumar, Narender; Peacock, Sharon J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Poonawala, Husain] Lowell Gen Hosp, 295 Varnum Ave, Lowell, MA 02446 USA","Poonawala, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res TB, 1 Mayor Sathyamoorthy Rd, Chennai 600031, Tamil Nadu, India.","MRC-DBT [MR/N501864/1]; National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai [BT/IN/DBT-MRC (UK)/12/SS/2015-2016]; Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi; MRC [MR/N501864/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Green Submitted,,,,,,,,,

Long-term data from permanent vegetation plots have yielded a wealth of data on the species diversity and dynamics of tree populations, but such studies have only rarely been undertaken in tropical forest landscapes that support large human populations. Thus, anthropogenic drivers and their impacts on species diversity and community structure of tropical forests are not well understood. Here we present data on species diversity, community composition, and regeneration status of tropical forests in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Ghats of southern India. Enumeration of 40 plots (50 m x 20 m) results a total of 106 species of trees, 76 species of saplings and 79 species of seedlings. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination of the tree populations yielded five dominant groups, along disturbance and altitudinal gradients on the first and second axes respectively. Abundant species of the area such as Albizia amara, Nothopegia racemosa and Pleiospermum alatum had relatively few individuals in recruiting size classes. Our data indicate probable replacement of rare, localized, and old-growth 'specialists' by disturbance-adapted generalists, if the degradation is continuing at the present scale.

Tree growth rates in a large permanent plot at Mudumalai, southern India, were examined for the influences of rainfall and three intrinsic factors (size, species and growth form) during three 4-year intervals over the period 1988-2000. Most trees had lowest growth during the second interval when rainfall was lowest, and skewness and kurtosis of growth distributions were reduced during this interval. Tree diameter generally explained < 10% of growth variation and had less influence on growth than species identity or time interval. Intraspecific variation was high, yet species identity accounted for up to 16% of growth variation in the community. There were no consistent differences between canopy and understory tree growth rates; however, a few subgroups of species may potentially represent canopy and understory growth guilds. Environmentally-induced temporal variations in growth generally did not reduce the odds of subsequent survival. Growth rates appear to be strongly influenced by species identity and environmental variability in the Mudumalai dry forest.

The species composition of a mangrove forest has been estimated utilising the red-edge spectral bands and chlorophyll absorption information from AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 data. In this study, three dominant species, Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Avicennia officinalis, have been classified using the random forest (RF) model for a mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Various combinations of reflectance/backscatter bands and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2, AVIRIS-NG, and Sentinel-1 were used for species-level discrimination and mapping. The RF model showed maximum accuracy using Sentinel-2, followed by the AVIRIS-NG, in discriminating three dominant species and two mixed compositions. This study indicates the potential of Sentinel-2 data for discriminating various mangrove species owing to the appropriate placement of central wavelength and bandwidth in Sentinel-2 at ≥10 m spatial resolution. The variable importance plots proved that species-level classification could be attempted using red edge and chlorophyll absorption information.

We tested the hypotheses that (i) regional rarity would be associated with local rarity and narrower ecological amplitudes, (ii) shorter and mechanically dispersed trees would be rarer, (iii) higher proportion of endemic species would be rare (iv) regionally wide ranging species would be locally rare, and localised species would be denser, (v) families with single species would be relicts in this biome, (vi) larger families would have a higher proportion of rare and endemic species. We used Atlas records in a generalised least square model acknowledging phylogenetic relationships, to test hypotheses (i) to (ii), and non parametric tests for (iii) to (vi). We identified rare species using binary cut-offs and compared these with IUCN threat status.

Exploratory data analysis is based on second-order neighbourhood and pair-correlation statistics used to describe the degree of clustering/regularity in patterns of all trees, and the degree of attraction/repulsion between young trees and adults. Stochastic simulations from the Markov point process models are then used to fit spatial interaction models. The results show that spatial patterns can be related to particular dynamic processes which depend on both exogenous and endogenous factors: on steep slopes disturbed by many treefalls, spatial pattern displays large clusters which can be interpreted as within-gap regeneration stages of various ages, while in areas undisturbed over a long period, interactions between young trees and adults give rise to spatial patterns consistent with substitution dynamic processes implying standing mortality rather than treefalls.

Delineation and identification of fire prone areas were done on the basis of historical ground fire data in conjunction with satellite remote sensing data provided by NRSA. The composition, structure and diversity of different forest fire zones was conducted by stratified random sampling to measure trees, saplings, seedlings, shrubs, herbs and litter. The regeneration pattern of the different forest fire zones was prepared by graphical population structures. The fuel load for each fire zones was estimated. The duffs litter and wood litter of all fire zones were weighed separately. Along the fire gradients the tree species exhibited highest density of seedlings in low fire zone. The highest density of saplings and trees were present in non-fire zone whereas shrubs and herbs layer showed the highest density in medium fire zone. In this study we found that non-fire zone contained more species as compared to burnt areas. The diversity pattern showed that the medium fire zone showed maximum diversity followed by non-fire zone, whereas low fire zone had minimum Shannon index. The regeneration pattern of tree species in all the fire zones and non-fire zone generally showed five general patterns.

In B. utilis forest, density and basal area of trees, and density of herbs and shrubs decreased with increasing disturbance. In Acer mixed forest, the decrease was for density and basal area of trees, and density of herbs. However, in A. pindrow forest, density of trees was highest in the degraded plots and total basal area peaked in the semi-degraded plots. Natural regeneration, expressed in terms of seedling and sapling density in different forest types, revealed the following pattern: (i) in B. utilis forest, the highest density of seedlings and saplings was in semi-degraded plots; (ii) in A. pindrow and Acer mixed forests, the density of seedlings and saplings was highest in the degraded plots. The present study indicates that the compositional attributes of sub-alpine forest communities in western Himalaya are sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, and the effects varied amongst the forest types and life forms.

The study was taken up for documentation and analysis of traditional knowledge regarding the practice and use of plants in the treatment of bone fracture. This is an effort to preserve the vanishing wealth of traditional knowledge. Materials and methods: Key informants identified in a preliminary survey and collection of information was through semi structured, open ended interviews. The details on age, place of practice, experience of key informants and learning of practice, disease they treat and mode of diagnosis, storage and usage of plants were collected. The identity of plants and their information was confirmed through repeated guided transect walks in different seasons with the informants and focus group discussions. Identified plants were deposited at the herbaria of Regional Medical Research Centre, Belgaum. Results: Forty four key informants providing treatment for bone fracture in this region were identified. Thirty eight plant species belonging to 24 families have been documented in the present study. Highest number of species representation is found in families Euphorbiaceae and Fabaceae. The habit of the species showed that 45% of the herbal drugs were obtained from trees, followed by herbs, shrubs and climbers and majority of plants used were collected from wild (76%). The stem or stem bark (33%) was most commonly used plant part to prepare medicine. Twenty six formulations of 30 plant species were directly used in treating bone fracture, where Cissus quadrangularis has the highest use-value (0.14). Eleven plants were found to be administered for bone strengthening, pain relieving, inflammation reduction and speedy recovery and Gmelina arborea has the highest use value (0.27).

,,,A1578,113,1579,Optimized grid representation of plant species richness in India-Utility of an existing national database in integrated ecological analysis,"Data on the distribution of plant species at spatial (grid) scales are required as input for integrative analysis along with related climate, environment, topography and soil data. Although the world's scientific community is increasingly generating data on plant species at various spatial grids and statistically interpolating and extrapolating the available information, data on plant diversity from the Asian continent are scant. Such data are unavailable for India, the mainland of which has part of three of the world's 36 biodiversity hotspots. Although sufficient field sampling is always impossible and impractical, it is essential to utilize fully any available database by adjudging the sampling sufficiency at a given scale. In this work, we used an exhaustive database of the plant species of the Indian mainland that was sufficient in terms of sampling vegetation types. We transformed the data, obtained the distribution at the 1 and 2 spatial grid levels and evaluated the sampling sufficiency at acceptable threshold limits (60% to 80%). The greatest species richness values recorded in the 0.04 ha quadrant, 1 degrees grid and 2 degrees grid were 59, 623 and 1244, respectively. Clench model was significantly (p value < 0.001) fitted using the plant species data at both the grid levels with a very high coefficient of determination (>0.95). At an acceptable threshold limit of 70%, almost all the grids at the 2 level and more than 80% of the grids at the 1 level were found to be sufficiently sampled. Sampling sufficiency was observed to be highly scale-dependent as a greater number of 2 grids attained asymptotic behaviour following the species area curve. Grid-level sampling insufficiency was attributed to lower numbers of sampling quadrats in forests with poor approachability, which coincided with the world biodiversity hotspots', suggesting that additional sampling was required. We prescribe the use of the 1 degrees and 2 degrees spatial grids with sufficient sampling for any ecological analysis in conjunction with other data and thereby offer grid-level plant species richness data for the Indian mainland for the first time.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173774,2017,PLOS ONE,"Tripathi, P; Behera, MD; Roy, PS",,,Distribution; Gomphostilbia; Oriental region; phylogeny; Simulium,EVOLUTION,Bharathidasan University,"[Anbalagan, Sankarappan; Kannan, Mani] Sethupathy Govt Arts Coll, Dept Zool, Ramanathapuram 623502, Tamil Nadu, India; [Dinakaran, Sundaram] Madura Coll, Dept Zool, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Krishnan, Muthukalingan] Bharathidasan Univ, Dept Environm Biotechnol, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India","Anbalagan, S (corresponding author), Sethupathy Govt Arts Coll, Dept Zool, Ramanathapuram 623502, Tamil Nadu, India.","Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) [SB/FT/LS-102/2012, ECR/2016/000191]",,,,,,,,,,

Various studies have been aimed towards assessing the impact of different restoration practices on coal mine wastelands. Plantation scheme in a scientific way is the most suitable approach in this context. During the present investigation, an effort have been made to assess the vegetation dynamics through structure, composition, diversity, and forest floor biomass analysis in and around Bishrampur collieries, Sarguja division, northern Chhattisgarh, India. We have tried to develop strategies for ecorestoration and habitat management of the concerned study sites. Four sites were randomly selected in different directions of the study area. We classified the vegetation community of the study sites into various strata on the basis of height. Two hundred forty quadrats were laid down in various directions of the study area to quantify vegetation under different strata. During our investigation, we found eight different tree species representing four families in the different study sites. The density of the various tree species ranged between 40 and 160 individuals ha-1. The density of sapling, seedling, shrub, and herb ranged between 740 and 1620; 2000 and 6000; 1200 and 2000; and 484,000 and 612,000 individuals ha-1, respectively, in different directions. The diversity indices of the tree reflected highest Shannon index value of 1.91. Simpsons index ranged between 0.28 and 0.50, species richness ranged between 0.27 and 0.61, equitability up to 1.44, and Beta diversity ranged between 2.00 and 4.00. Total forest floor biomass ranged between 4.20 and 5.65 t/ha among the study sites. Highest forest floor biomass occurred in the south direction and lowest at east direction. Total forest floor biomass declined by 6.19% in west, 13.10% in north, and 25.66% in east direction, respectively. The mining activities resulted significant damage to natural vegetation and its dynamics. The study indicated that Acacia mangium, Cassia siamea, and Dalbergia sissoo can be recommended for effective eco-restoration of the concerned sites due to cosmopolitan distribution, high regeneration potential, as well as existence in the form of various girth classes with stable population structure.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6086-0,2017,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Kumar, A; Jhariya, MK; Yadav, DK; Banerjee, A",,,Above ground biomass; Allometric model; CO2 sequestration; Karankadu swamp; Mangrove ecosystem; Palk Bay,ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; WOODY BIOMASS; FOREST; PRODUCTIVITY; TREE; EQUATIONS; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; SEQUESTRATION; ESTUARY,Madurai Kamaraj University; Anna University; Anna University Chennai,"[Prasanna, J.; Anand, M.; Kumaraguru, A.

In Indian tropical forests, the information on variation in tree biomass and C stocks at forest type level is scarce and fragmented. In the present study, three tropical dry deciduous forest types: dry deciduous teak forest (DDTF), dry deciduous mixed forest (DDMF) and Boswellia forest (BF) have been selected in Madhya Pradesh, Central India, to assess the biomass and C stocks. The total tree biomass (aboveground + belowground) ranged from 70.4 (DDTF) to 296.6 (BF) Mg/ha with a mean of 184.1 Mg/ha, whereas the tree C ranged from 35.3 (DDTF) to 140.9 (BF) Mg C/ha with a mean value of 87.4 Mg C/ha. The greatest biomass (220.4 Mg/ha) and C stocks (104.7 Mg C/ha) have been observed in BF type, whereas the least biomass (160.9 Mg/ha) and C (76.4 Mg C/ha) have been observed in DDTF type, with the mean biomass and C stock values of 184.1 Mg/ha and 87.4 Mg C/ha, respectively. In both DDTF and DDMF types, Tectona grandis contributed 76.5 and 26.4% of C, whereas in BF type, Boswellia serrata contributed 73.6% of C to the total C stock. A significant positive (R2 = 0.951; p < 0.01) relationship has been observed between basal area and tree C stock.

high levels of endemism, thus making them a conservation priority worldwide (Bruijnzeel 2001,
Hamilton et al. 1995). The TMFs are considered to be among the most threatened tropical forest of
the world (Hamilton et al. 1995, Aldrich et al. 1997, Bubb et al. 2004). Most of them are fragmented
remnants of the original forests (Gentry 1995, Hamilton et al. 1995, Aldrich et al. 1997). In India,
montane forests occur in the Himalayas, north-eastern India, and in the Western Ghats, covering
almost 8% of the total forested area of the country (Lal 1989).
The Western Ghats of India, 1 of 25 biodiversity hotspots of the world (Myers 2000), is facing several
threats to its biodiversity due to human impact (Pramod et al. 1997). The TMFs of the Western Ghats
occur at elevations of 1,400–2,400 m and are better known as the Shola forest locally (Bunyan et al.
2012, Robin and Nandini 2012). The Sholas form a unique habitat of an evergreen forest interspersed
with grasslands, both often separated by sharp ecotones (Matthew 1999). This montane ecosystem is
characterized by high levels of endemism (Thomas and Palmer 2007).
Most of the studies and research conducted at the Shola forest are of a descriptive nature and there are
very few studies concerning climate change, ecological restoration, and the major threats faced by this very

The present study focuses on investigating the potential use of a one time, QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR L-band 25 m data to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) using a water cloud model (WCM) in a wildlife sanctuary in India. A significant correlation was obtained between the SAR-derived backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) and the field measured AGB, with the maximum coefficient of determination for cross-polarized (HV) sigma degrees for Shorea robusta, and the weakest correlation was observed with co-polarized (HH) sigma degrees for Tectona grandis forests. The biomass of S. robusta and that of T. grandis were estimated on the basis of field-measured data at 444.7 +/- 170.4 Mg/ha and 451 +/- 179.4 Mg/ha respectively. The mean biomass values estimated using the WCM varied between 562 and 660 Mg/ha for S. robusta; between 590 and 710 Mg/ha for T. grandis using various polarized data. Our results highlighted the efficacy of one time, fully polarized PALSAR data for biomass and carbon estimate in a dense forest. (C) 2015 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

,,,A1491,120,1492,Patterns of tree-liana interactions: distribution and host preference of lianas in a tropical dry evergreen forest in India,"Lianas are structurally dependent life-form that rely mostly on trees to access the forest canopy. The complex interactions between lianas and trees are often effected by host species' traits. Lianas are evolved with various climbing mechanisms that aid them attach and infest the host trees. Liana infestation on trees now seems to be common in many tropical forests, where they are abundant. The present study was aimed to investigate the patterns of liana-tree interactions in tropical dry evergreen forest of Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary (PCWS), southeast India. This study also analyzes the impact of various tree functional traits on liana colonization success in the PCWS. All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height (gbh) was measured along with lianas (>= 1 cm diameter at 1.3 m from the rooting point) they hosted. Overall, 57.9% of trees in the study sites carried at least one liana. The infested trees hosted an average of 1.53 +/- 0.49 (range; 0-8) lianas per tree. At PCWS, the trees with medium girth-class, moderate wood specific density, rough bark and those with pronounced summer leaflessness are more prone to be infested by lianas. The preference of lianas under different climbing mechanisms in selecting host trees remained similar, although their proportion differed slightly in the present study. Liana infestation on host trees can be highly dynamic under the current scenario of increasing liana abundance and biomass in tropical forests world over for which, we recommend the need for documenting the patterns of tree-liana interactions, by employing a standard protocol to facilitate global comparisons.",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),2017,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Vivek, P; Parthasarathy, N",,,,SOIL-QUALITY; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; ORGANIC-CARBON; USE EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS; ROTATION; TILLAGE; INDEXES; SYSTEMS,Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"[Batabyal, K.; Mandal, B.; Sarkar, D.; Murmu, S.] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India","Batabyal, K (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers today are trying to understand the climatic variations, especially those occurring due to destruction of forest and its corresponding biomass loss. Hence, quantification of various forest parameters such as biomass is imperative for evaluating the carbon. The objective of this research was to exploit the potential of C-band Radarsat-2 Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) technique for analysing the relationship between complex coherence and field-estimated aboveground biomass. Association between the backscatter and the aboveground biomass was also established in the process. To serve our objective, Radarsat-2 interferometric pair dated 4th March, 2013(master image) and 28th March, 2013 (slave image) were procured for the Barkot Reserve Forest region of Dehradun, India. Field sampling was done for 30 plots (31.62m x 31.62m) and stem diameter and tree height were measured in each plot. The study emphasized on the application of POLINSAR coherence instead of using conventional method of relying on backscatter values for retrieving forest biomass. Coherence matrices were utilized for generating complex coherence values for different polarization channels and were regressed against field estimated aboveground biomass. Results indicated a negative linear relationship between complex coherence and aboveground biomass with the cross - polarized coherence showing the highest R-2 value of 0.71. Further, the backscatter mechanism when studied with respect to aboveground biomass indicated a positive linear relationship between backscatter values and field estimated aboveground biomass with R-2 value of 0.45 and 0.61 for slave and master image respectively. The results suggest that PolInSAR technique, in combination with different modelling approaches, can be adopted for estimating forest biomass.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-631-2014,2014,ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM,"Singh, J; Kumar, S; Kushwaha, SPS",,,Deforestation; Fragmentation; Conservation; Remote sensing; GIS; Eastern Ghats; India,COVER CHANGES; GROSS,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Reddy, C.

These sites are also sacred groves and forest fragments experiencing various levels of human disturbance and can be classified as relatively undisturbed (AP), moderately disturbed (KR, SP and RP) or highly disturbed (MM). Site disturbances were categorized based on forest encroachment, temple visitors' impact, resource extraction and the degree of cattle and goat browsing. All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height in the five plots were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. A total of 60 tree species belonging to 49 genera and 26 families were recorded. Tree species richness was as low as 19 species per hectare in the moderately disturbed site RP to as high as 35 species in the relatively undisturbed site AP. Tree density ranged from 596 stems per hectare in site KR to 1663 trees in site SP and that of basal area from 12.4 m(2) (in RP) to 22.1 m(2) per hectare (in SP). Three species Memecylon umbellatum, Chloroxylon swietenia and Pterospermum conescens scored high importance value index. The Rubiaceae, Mimosaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rutaceae and Sapindaceae constituted the most-speciose families. Among the five sites, SP exemplified a mono-specific dominant tropical forest, with Memecylon umbellatum occupying 69% of the total forest stand density. In all five sites tree species richness and density decreased with increasing girth class. The stand structure of forest sites displayed a reverse J-shaped curve with the exception of site KR. Spatial patterns of trees in the five sites revealed that the individuals of most species are clumped at the 1-ha scale. The non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, based on species richness, diversity indices, stand density, basal area, species population density and disturbance scores, organized the sites into three clusters, chiefly influenced by three variables-species richness, density of predominant species and site disturbance score.

Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in north-western Himalaya: Implications of different forest management regimes,"Sustainable forest management is the key to biodiversity conservation, flow of resources and climate change mitigation. We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) and minimum in CSF (90.28Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ).

The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (> 20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites. The Oorani grove (3.2 ha) had 74 flowering plant species distributed in 71 genera and 41 families; 30 of them are woody species, 8 are lianas and 4 are parasites. The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre. The attendant cultural rites and religious rituals have perpetuated the status of a sacred grove which has ensured the protection of the grove.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1016637627623,2001,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Ramanujam, MP; Kadamban, D",,,plantations; teak; India; restoration; secondary forests,TREE PLANTATIONS; SOILS; REGENERATION; MANAGEMENT,Wildlife Institute of India,"Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India","Saha, S (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Sci Biol, SES, M-C 066,845 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1317,127,1318,Functional trait and community phylogenetic analyses reveal environmental filtering as the major determinant of assembly of tropical forest tree communities in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India,"Background: Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood. Methods: Here, we perform an integrated analysis of the data on tree species abundance, functional traits and community phylogeny from a network of 96 forest plots, each 1 ha in size, distributed along a broad environmental gradient in the central Western Ghats, India. Then, we determine the relative importance of various process in assembly and structuring of tropical forest communities with evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. Results: The deciduous leaf phenological trait has repeatedly evolved among multiple distantly related lineages. Tree communities in dry deciduous forests were phylogenetically clustered and showed a low range and variance of functional traits related to light harvesting, reproduction, and growth suggesting niche-based processes such as environmental filtering play a vital role in the assembly of tree communities in these forests. The external factors such as human-mediated disturbance also significantly, but to a lesser extent, influences the species and phylogenetic turnover. Conclusions: These findings revealed that the environmental filtering plays a significant role in assembly of tree communities in the biologically diverse tropical forests in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40663-018-0144-0,2018,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,"Shivaprakash, KN; Ramesh, BR; Umashaanker, R; Dayanandan, S",,Same data as Ramesh et al.

,,,A3247,128,3248,Species-area and species-individual relationships for tropical trees: A comparison of three 50-ha plots,"1 Species-accumulation curves for woody plants were calculated in three tropical forests, based on fully mapped 50-ha plots in wet, old-growth forest in Peninsular Malaysia, in moist, old-growth forest in central Panama, and in dry, previously logged forest in southern India. A total of 610 000 stems were identified to species and mapped to < Im accuracy. Mean species number and stem number were calculated in quadrats as small as 5 m x 5 m to as large as 1000 m x 500 m, for a variety of stem sizes above 10 mm in diameter. Species-area curves were generated by plotting species number as a function of quadrat size; species-individual curves were generated from the same data, but using stem number as the independent variable rather than area. 2 Species-area curves had different forms for stems of different diameters, but species-individual curves were nearly independent of diameter class. With < 10(4) stems, species-individual curves were concave downward on log-log plots, with curves from different forests diverging, but beyond about 104 stems, the log-log curves became nearly linear, with all three sites having a similar slope. This indicates an asymptotic difference in richness between forests: the Malaysian site had 2.7 times as many species as Panama, which in turn was 3.3 times as rich as India. 3 Other details of the species-accumulation relationship were remarkably similar between the three sites. Rectangular quadrats had 5-27% more species than square quadrats of the same area, with longer and narrower quadrats increasingly diverse. Random samples of stems drawn from the entire 50 ha had 10-30% more species than square quadrats with the same number of stems. At both Pasoh and BCI, but not Mudumalai. species richness was slightly higher among intermediate-sized stems (50-100mm in diameter) than in either smaller or larger sizes, These patterns reflect aggregated distributions of individual species, plus weak density-dependent forces that tend to smooth the species abundance distribution and 'loosen' aggregations as stems grow. 4 The results provide support for the view that within each tree community, many species have their abundance and distribution guided more by random drift than deterministic interactions. The drift model predicts that the species-accumulation curve will have a declining slope on a log-log plot, reaching a slope of O.1 in about 50 ha. No other model of community structure can make such a precise prediction. 5 The results demonstrate that diversity studies based on different stem diameters can be compared by sampling identical numbers of stems. Moreover, they indicate that stem counts < 1000 in tropical forests will underestimate the percentage difference in species richness between two diverse sites. Fortunately, standard diversity indices (Fisher's sc, Shannon-Wiener) captured diversity differences in small stem samples more effectively than raw species richness, but both were sample size dependent. Two nonparametric richness estimators (Chao. jackknife) performed poorly, greatly underestimating true species richness.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.2307/2261477,1996,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Condit, R; Hubbell, SP; Lafrankie, JV; Sukumar, R; Manokaran, N; Foster, RB; Ashton, PS",,Mudumalai 50ha plot,microbial biomass; soil nutrient pool; forest regrowth,SOIL BIOMASS; NITROGEN; MINERALIZATION; PHOSPHORUS; FUMIGATION; PASTURE; CARBON; RANGE,North Eastern Hill University,"NE HILL UNIV,DEPT BOT,PLANT ECOL DEPT,SHILLONG 793022,MEGHALAYA,INDIA",,,,,,,,,,,,

Field assessments were conducted on 6 predominant land uses including (a) natural forest (NF), (b) degraded forest (DF), (c) rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation (RP), (d) Areca (Areca catechu) plantation (ArP), (e) pan (Piper betle) jhum (slash and mulching) agroforestry (PB), and (f) Imperata grassland (IG) of Northeast India to assess changes in ecosystem C stock with progressive and retrogressive LUC. Ecosystem C stock was the highest for NF (300.5Mg ha(-1)) and the lowest under IG (110.4Mg ha(-1)). The ecosystem C stock under PB and IG was 11% and 63%, respectively, lower than that under NF. In comparison with DF, the gain in ecosystem C was in the order PB (125%)>RP (99%)>ArP (4%). The ratio of soil organic carbon to ecosystem C stock was similar to 50% for NF, PB, and RP and that shifted to similar to 80% for ArP/DF/IG. The LUC and management of DF through PB and RP indicated the ecosystem C sequestration rate of 5 and 4Mg ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. Similarly, the ecosystem C sequestration rate was 0.5 and 4Mg ha(-1)year(-1), respectively, when IG was converted into ArP and RP. Therefore, restoration of degraded lands (viz., DF and IG) through RP and PB enhanced ecosystem C sequestration rate and reduced CO2 emissions from LUC.

Accurate estimation of forest biomass C is needed to provide information on C fluxes and balances in such systems. The objective of this study was to develop generalized biomass models using harvest data covering tropical semi-evergreen, tropical wet evergreen, sub-tropical broad leaved, and sub-tropical pine forest in North East India (NEI). Among the four biomass estimation models (BEMs) tested AGB(est) = 0.32((DH)-H-2)(0.75) x 1.34 and AGB(est) = 0.18D(2.16) x 1.32 were found to be the first and second best models for the different forest types in NEI. The study also revealed that four commonly used generic models developed by Chambers (2001), Brown (1989), Chave (2005) and Chave (2014) overestimated biomass stocks by 300-591 kg tree(-1), while our highest rated model overestimated biomass by 197 kg tree(-1).

,,,A1260,135,1261,Microenvironmental heterogeneity caused by anthropogenic LULC foster lower plant assemblages in the riparian habitats of lentic systems in tropical floodplains,"Anthropogenic land use and land cover (LULC) create a heterogeneous environment in the floodplains. This heterogeneity may be governing plant species assemblages, diversity, and dominance patterns in the riparian habitats of the lentic systems in tropical floodplains. We tested this hypothesis in the floodplains of Barak river basin in northeast India following standard methods of plant and soil sampling/analysis and multivariate statistical tools. Plant community studies in the riparian habitats of the selected lentic systems were done at monthly intervals for a period of one year, while soil sampling and analysis were done at bimonthly intervals. Standard data visualization plots and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to assess spatiotemporal variations in species richness and diversity, environmental heterogeneity, and species-environment association. The study revealed that anthropogenic land use and land cover significantly affects species assemblage, diversity, and dominance in the riparian habitats. The variations in vegetation structure and composition with respect to the adjoining land use type plausibly have implications on the structure and functioning of the lentic systems. Thus, the study recommends that a holistic approach involving the riparian areas is required for effective management of tropical floodplains. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosa lindleyana, Memecylon umbellatum, Syzygium cumini and S. caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements, The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1 : 1.5-2.5 for the low (0-1 ha), intermediate (1-2 ha) and rich (>2 ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.

Fifteen villages dominated by tribal communities, under five Community Development Blocks were selected. A semi structured questionnaire was developed to bring together data on traditional crops and forest species still used by the communities. The methodology engaged was personal discussions with mixed focused groups combined with field visits, photographs, voice recordings and collection of materials. Findings were that tribal communities cultivate a diverse crop species with varying durations to meet their food and economic requirement throughout the year. This was supplemented by wild food collections during scarcity periods. Various forest species provide wood, fibre, leaves and grasses for agriculture, house construction and specific uses besides enhancing household income. Tribal health care practitioners collect medicinal plants from the wild and semi wild to treat both humans and livestock. At the end of the study the team assumed that tribal communities would continue to depend on traditional crops and wild forest foods for their household consumption and a diverse species of plants for other specific use. Conservation of these valuable resources in its natural habitat would be an appropriate approach for ensuring food security of future generations. Conventional plant breeders and biotechnologists should undertake scientific validation of these crops and plants to make their value explicitly known.

,,,A1216,141,1217,Phylogenetic diversity in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot reflects environmental filtering and past niche diversification of trees,"Aim We examined how contrasted climatic conditions influenced the ecological and phylogenetic diversity of tropical trees at the regional scale. Beyond the basic expectation of greater environmental filtering in currently stressful contexts, we addressed how biogeographic history and past climates contributed to shaping the distribution and diversity of extant taxa. Location Evergreen forests of Western Ghats, India. Methods We evaluated the relative importance of niche-based, historical, and spatial processes on community phylogenetic structure and turnover in 297 plots including 459 species. If niche conservatism prevails, we expected greater phylogenetic clustering under harsher or historically less stable climates, and overdispersion in opposite conditions. To test the role of environmental filtering in shaping local communities, we assessed species' climatic niches and congruence between niche and phylogenetic diversity. To assess the imprint of ancient versus recent evolutionary constraints, we calculated mean pair-wise (MPD) and nearest-taxon (MNTD) phylogenetic distances, respectively. Results We found non-random phylogenetic structure depending on both current and past climatic variation. Basal community phylogenetic structure (MPD) was related to niche diversity and varied according to hydric stress: (a) northern environments filtered more closely related species, while (b) phylogenetic overdispersion suggested greater niche differentiation in stable, least-seasonal southern habitats and at high elevations. Terminal phylogenetic structure (MNTD) did not show overdispersion. Phylogenetic turnover was driven by current abiotic factors, not space. Main conclusions The patterns of ecological and phylogenetic diversity likely reflect the Miocene climate shift to increasing seasonality northwards. Phylogenetic clustering under hydric stress or historical instability suggests the influence of functional conservatism, whereas overdispersion in southern forests supports the persistence of old lineages in an ancient rain forest refugium as an evolutionary museum. Overdispersion in fragmented montane forests reflects a mixture of biogeographically distinct species pools, both tropical and temperate, that characterise environmentally contrasted cores and fringes.

,,,A1767,142,1768,Random Forest Regression modelling for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation using RISAT-1 PolSAR and Terrestrial LiDAR Data,"SAR and LiDAR remote sensing have already shown the potential of active sensors for forest parameter retrieval. SAR sensor in its fully polarimetric mode has an advantage to retrieve scattering property of different component of forest structure and LiDAR has the capability to measure structural information with very high accuracy. This study was focused on retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) based point clouds and scattering property of forest vegetation obtained from decomposition modelling of RISAT-1 fully polarimetric SAR data. TLS data was acquired for 14 plots of Timli forest range, Uttarakhand, India. The forest area is dominated by Sal trees and random sampling with plot size of 0.1 ha (31.62m* 31.62m) was adopted for TLS and field data collection. RISAT-1 data was processed to retrieve SAR data based variables and TLS point clouds based 3D imaging was done to retrieve LiDAR based variables. Surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, volume scattering, helix and wire scattering were the SAR based variables retrieved from polarimetric decomposition. Tree heights and stem diameters were used as LiDAR based variables retrieved from single tree vertical height and least square circle fit methods respectively. All the variables obtained for forest plots were used as an input in a machine learning based Random Forest Regression Model, which was developed in this study for forest AGB estimation. Modelled output for forest AGB showed reliable accuracy (RMSE = 27.68 t/ha) and a good coefficient of determination (0.63) was obtained through the linear regression between modelled AGB and field-estimated AGB. The sensitivity analysis showed that the model was more sensitive for the major contributed variables (stem diameter and volume scattering) and these variables were measured from two different remote sensing techniques. This study strongly recommends the integration of SAR and LiDAR data for forest AGB estimation.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2227380,2016,LIDAR REMOTE SENSING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING XV,"Mangla, R; Kumar, S; Nandy, S",,,Lavandula; phylogeny; polyploidy; biogeography; C-value; trnK-matK; plastid marker,PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; LAMIACEAE; LABIATAE,Universite de Rouen Normandie; Universite Jean Monnet; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); VetAgro Sup,"[Moja, S.; Guitton, Y.; Nicole, F.; Jullien, F.] Univ Lyon, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Moja, S.; Guitton, Y.; Nicole, F.; Jullien, F.] Univ St Etienne, Lab BVpam, EA3061, 23 Rue Dr Paul Michelon, F-42000 St Etienne, France; [Legendre, L.] Univ Lyon, F-69622 Lyon, France; [Legendre, L.] Univ Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France; [Legendre, L.] CNRS, Ecol Microbienne, UMR5557, Villeurbanne, France; [Pasquier, B.] CNPMAI, Route Nemours, F-91490 Milly La Foret, France; [Upson, T.] Cambridge Univ Bot Garden, 1 Brookside, Cambridge CB2 1JF, England","Moja, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, F-42023 St Etienne, France.;Moja, S (corresponding author), Univ St Etienne, Lab BVpam, EA3061, 23 Rue Dr Paul Michelon, F-42000 St Etienne, France.",Region Rhone-Alpes (France); Conseil General de l'Essonne,,,,,,,,,,

Terminalia arjuna is one such species that is dominant in the riparian landscapes along the River Cauvery in Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. We tested the hypothesis that T. arjuna influences plant community composition in riparian landscapes and supports a distinct local riparian community. We showed plant species richness, diversity, similarity in community composition, and soil quality varied between riparian landscapes under canopy of T. arjuna and areas devoid of T. arjuna. Higher species richness, diversity, dominance, and evenness were noted in areas under canopy of T. arjuna. The non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination space analysis identifies the native riparian species assemblages in areas under canopy of T. arjuna with improved soil nutrient conditions. Overall, the study concludes T. arjuna has potential positive effects on riparian landscapes by showing the remarkable differences in biological diversity and it can be considered as keystone species in riparian ecosystems of South India.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2018.1560400,2019,LANDSCAPE RESEARCH,"Sunil, C; Somashekar, RK; Nagaraja, BC",,,,PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES; CYCADACEAE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DISPERSAL; EVOLUTION; ISLANDS,University of Peradeniya; University of Peradeniya; University of Peradeniya,"[Mudannayake, Asanka; Perera, Anoma] Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; [Mudannayake, Asanka; Samaraweera, Preminda; Sooriyapathirana, Suneth; Perera, Anoma] Univ Peradeniya, Postgrad Inst Sci, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; [Ranaweera, Lahiru; Samaraweera, Preminda; Sooriyapathirana, Suneth] Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka","Perera, A (corresponding author), Univ Peradeniya, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.;Perera, A (corresponding author), Univ Peradeniya, Postgrad Inst Sci, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.",University of Peradeniya Research Grant [RG/AF 2013/72/S],"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

,,,A1663,150,1664,Plant species richness pattern across India's longest longitudinal extent,"Although the longitudinal pattern of biological diversity may not be as striking as the latitudinal pattern, there are climatic gradients associated with habitat, topography and disturbance, which may generate variation in biological diversity along a longitudinal extent. We analysed the pattern of plant diversity using field data gathered from a national level 'biodiversity characterization at landscape level' project, along the longest longitudinal extent of India, varying from desert to wet tropics. Across a 3 degrees latitudinal band (25-27 degrees N lat.), the aridity decreased drastically from west to east, and the vegetation varied from tropical thorn, tropical deciduous, tropical semi-evergreen to tropical evergreen forests. In general, the species diversity is maximum in the east, minimum in the centre and intermediate in the west. The proportion (with respect to total number of species of each corresponding grid) of woody trees increased by half and shrubs increased by one-third, whereas herbal proportion decreased by half from western to eastern grid. The major predictor of species richness was the number of forest vegetation types, followed by topography (ruggedness index); together these explained 63% of the variance as revealed from generalized linear modelling analysis. The study concludes that, from west to east, (i) the vegetation type varies from tropical thorn to tropical moist/wet evergreen forest corresponding to aridity; (ii) there is monotonic drastic increase of woody tree, moderate increase of shrub, and drastic decrease of herb species, and (iii) plant diversity has a nonlinear distribution pattern attributed mainly to variation in the number of forest vegetation types followed by abiotic topography and climate.

These groves harbour rich biodiversity and play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity. Population structure and regeneration status of woody species were studied during 2001-2002 in the four sacred groves of Manipur, a state in north east India. A total of 96 woody species was recorded from the four groves, the highest being Konthoujam Lairembi sacred grove (55 species) and lowest in Heingang Marjing sacred grove having 42 species. The density-diameter distribution of woody species in the four groves showed highest stand density and species richness in the lowest girth class (30-60 cm) and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. Overall population structure of the groves based on the number of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, displayed a greater proportion of seedlings followed by saplings and adults while for the selected tree species it varied seasonally and recruitment of species increased during rainy season attaining peak during June. Regeneration status of the four sacred groves based on strength of different age groups in their population showed good regeneration. High occurrence of 'additional species' to the groves may be due to the invasion through dispersal from other areas. Possibly, the prevailing favourable microenvironmental conditions contributed to their establishment and growth in the groves. Absence of seedlings and saplings of some of the species in the groves may be due to their poor seed germination and establishment of seedlings in the forest.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-6901-0,2006,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Khumbongmayum, AD; Khan, M; Tripathi, RS",,,sulfur oxidation; chemolithoautotrophic paracocci; Paracoccus bengalensis sp nov.; leguminous rhizosphere,THIOSPHAERA-PANTOTROPHA; GEN.

,,,A1706,152,1707,Seed size predicts community composition and carbon storage potential of tree communities in rain forest fragments in India's Western Ghats,"1. Fragmentation is ubiquitous across tropical forests and drives marked shifts in tree community composition by differentially affecting species' dispersal, establishment and survival. Such compositional shifts can potentially alter ecosystem-level properties such as above-ground carbon storage, but our understanding of the factors linking compositional shifts to carbon storage is limited. 2. We compared tree communities of contiguous and fragmented tropical rain forests in the Western Ghats (India) and assessed the ability of various plant functional traits associated with seed dispersal, establishment and survival processes to predict species' responses to fragmentation. 3. Further, we assessed relationships between functional traits that predict tree community turnover and those that govern carbon storage to examine how fragmentation effects on species' composition can alter the ability of tree communities to store carbon. 4. Seed size, as indexed by seed length, was the best predictor of species' responses, with larger-seeded species declining in fragments. Across species, seed length was positively correlated with maximum attainable height, which decreased by 10% on average at the community level in fragments. Such shifts towards smaller-seeded communities could decrease forest stature and reduce above-ground carbon stocks by 8%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights a previously undescribed mechanism by which fragmentation-driven declines of large-seeded tree species can reduce above-ground carbon stocks by promoting shorter-statured forests. These results imply that strict protection alone might be insufficient and that a multipronged conservation strategy would be required to sustain carbon stocks in tropical forest fragments. Such interventions will need to combine restoration programmes for large-seeded tree species in fragments with broader-scale efforts to maintain hospitable and well-connected landscapes for their seed dispersers.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12626,2016,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Osuri, AM; Sankaran, M",,,Trees outside forests; High resolution data; Geospatial; Remote sensing,SCALE,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Osmania University; Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Hyderabad","[Pujar, G.

Assessment of carbon stock in forest vegetation is necessary for atmospheric carbon mitigation plans. The present study aimed to assess the total carbon stock in tree vegetation of Kolli hill (KH), a reserve forest located in India. The land area of KH (508 km(2)) was parted by 6.25 x 6.25 km(2) grids. In each grid, a transect of 0.5 ha (5 m x 1000 m) was laid randomly, and all live trees greater than or equal to 30 cm girth (=9.55 cm diameter) measure at breast height were sampled. Carbon stock of each tree was determined by non-destructive method. The carbon stock estimated for KH forest was 73.7 +/- 13.6 tC/ha. Maximum carbon stock was shared by Alseodaphne semicarpifolia var. semecarpifolia (14 %) among 157 species and Lauraceae (19 %) among 49 families recorded at KH. Statistical analysis revealed that the carbon stock values varied significantly among the eleven tree size classes (ANOVA, F-(10,F-187) = 4.439, p<0.001) and among the three major forest types (F-(2,F-15) = 6.101, p<0.05) recognized.

,,,A2630,156,2631,Tree community change in a tropical dry forest: the role of roads and exotic plant invasion,"Among the most endangered tropical ecosystems, tropical dry forests are threatened by degradation that includes edge effects arising from perturbations Such as the creation and maintenance of roads and other clearings. While much is known about these adverse effects on tree communities in tropical moist forests, similar effects in tropical dry forests are little understood. This paper examines the relationship between roads, road-related exotic plant invasion and tree community change in a tropical dry forest in Southern India. Forty pairs of roadside and interior plots across four factorial combinations of road width (wide and narrow) and understorey type (native and exotic) were sampled. Tree death and extant tree community composition were compared using generalized linear models and similarity analyses. Tree death near roads was more than double that away from them, suggesting that roads may increase tree death in these forests. The interactive effect of Understorey type (exotic or native) and road width on tree death was significant, with highest tree death near wide roads bordered by exotic Understorey. Conversely, tree community composition was influenced by road width and understorey type, but not by proximity to roads. Creation and maintenance of roads for forest management may have serious implications for tree communities in tropical dry forests and should thus be minimized. Exotic plants may also be important contributors to increasing tree death, and further research on their impacts, particularly into underlying mechanisms, is critical to the long-term conservation of tropical dry forest communities.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892909990257,2009,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Prasad, AE",,,Carbon sequestration; Carbon credits; Afforestation; Reforestation; Remote sensing,BIOMASS,"Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)","[Kale, Manish P.] Ctr Dev Adv Comp, Pune 411005, Maharashtra, India; [Ravan, Shirish A.] UN OOSA, A-1400 Vienna, Austria; [Roy, P.

The above-ground biomass from field-based inventory varied from 30.2 to 151.1 ton/ha in moist deciduous forest, 9.2-99.1 ton/ha in dry deciduous forest, 42.1-158.6 ton/ha in semi-evergreen forest, and 160.9-271 ton/ha in evergreen forest. The total above-ground biomass of the study area was estimated to be 95.2 M tons. A regression equation between field above-ground biomass and a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was used for spectral modeling to estimate and prepare the above-ground biomass map in the region. A total 120 plant species in 81 genera and 31 families were identified in the study area. This study emphasizes the importance of relic forests for their biodiversity, carbon sequestration and total biomass.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11842-016-9337-y,2016,SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY,"Das, S; Singh, TP",,,,SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT; EDIBLE MUSHROOMS; AURICULARIA-AURICULA; GENETIC DIVERSITY; LENTINULA-EDODES; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; CULTIVATED STRAINS; ANTIOXIDANT; CHINA; RAPD,Mizoram University; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Directorate of Mushroom Research,"[Lallawmsanga; Passari, Ajit Kumar; Mishra, Vineet Kumar; Leo, Vincent Vineeth; Singh, Bhim Pratap] Mizoram Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Mol Microbiol & Systemat Lab, Mizoram, India; [Gupta, Vijai Kumar] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Dept Biochem, Mol Glycobiotechnol Grp, Galway, Ireland; [Meyyappan, Geetha Valliammai; Uthandi, Sivakumar] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Dept Agr Microbiol, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Upadhyay, Ramesh Chandra] ICAR Res Complex, Directorate Mushroom Res, Solan, Himachal Prades, India","Singh, BP (corresponding author), Mizoram Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Mol Microbiol & Systemat Lab, Mizoram, India.","DBT sponsored NER-Twinning project, the Government of India, New Delhi [BT/320/NE/TBP/2012]","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

On plots of a fixed size, does stem density alone predict number of species? Are differences in density related to disturbance and altitude? Location: Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve, central India. Methods: 42 sites, each with three replicate 10-m radius plots, were examined. All trees (>= 30 cm GBH) in each plot were measured for firth at breast height, alpha-diversity, species richness and evenness were calculated for each site. The sites were ordinated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) using relative importance values of component species. Correspondence Analysis was used to broadly delineate communities. Anthropogenic disturbances, were recorded in terms of percentage of trees lopped, scale of lopping, number of domestic livestock dung piles and foot trails (both livestock and people) for each plot. Results: The NMS analysis exhibited a near linear arrangement of sites with no evidence of discrete vegetation zones. NMS axes were significantly related to altitude and disturbance scores. With increasing elevation, basal area increased but number of species. alpha-diversity and its components declined monotonically. The number of species and indices of species diversity were positively associated with free lopping and also with total disturbance. Number of species was controlled by stem density only ill plots not dominated by Shorea robusta. Conclusions: Recent levels of human disturbance are associated with higher species diversity in this biosphere reserve. There is some evidence that stands at all altitudes follow the same successional pattern to dominance by Shorea. a successional pattern that also results in decreased diversity without disturbance.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3170/2008-7-18537,2008,APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Sahu, PK; Sagar, R; Singh, JS",,,Canarium strictum; conservation; India; non-timber forest products; resin; Western Ghats,BILIGIRI RANGAN HILLS; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; WESTERN-GHATS; EXTRACTION,University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"[Ticktin, Tamara] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,International Development Research Centre (IDRC); NSF [OISE03-52827],,,,,,,,,,

Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with SAR backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an RMSE value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an RMSE value of 79.45 t/ha. This study shows that Sentinel series satellite data has exceptional capabilities in estimating dense forest AGB and machine learning algorithms can be very helpful to do so.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.05.011,2018,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"Ghosh, SM; Behera, MD",,,CCSM4; MaxEnt; Range expansion; Species distribution model,LAND-USE; CHANGE IMPACTS; FOREST; DIVERSITY; INDIA; UTTARAKHAND; MODELS; L.; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE,Wildlife Institute of India; University of British Columbia,"[Mungi, Ninad Avinash; Ramesh, K.; Rawat, Gopal S.] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Coops, Nicholas C.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Forest Resources Management, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","Mungi, NA (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",Queen Elizabeth Scholarship,,,,,,,,,,

The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km(2) each, had woody floras of 89 +/- 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources ( 92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022834722091,2003,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Veach, R; Lee, D; Philippi, T",,,afforestation; salinity control; saline irrigation; arid soil rehabilitation; salt tolerance; degraded lands; water use; carbon enrichment; irrigated plantations,WATER IRRIGATION; GROWTH,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Soil Salinity Research Institute,"Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, AICRP Management Salt Affected Soils & Use Saline, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India","Minhas, PS (corresponding author), Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, AICRP Management Salt Affected Soils & Use Saline, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

The land use changes directly influence the amount of carbon stored in vegetation and soil releasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to understand and analyze the carbon sequestration rate in relation to land use change, an assessment of above ground carbon and its variation with time is important. Aboveground biomass of tree species has been considered as a very good proxy for carbon assessment but only few attempts have been made in this regard. The present study aims to estimate the change in the above ground biomass and carbon stock for a period of 10 years for three major forest types (Deodar, Oak, and Pine) in Shimla district as a consequence to landuse dynamics using NDVIbased approach. Non-destructive sampling techniques have been used for preparing the forest inventory for two time periods (2003 and 2013). The correlation between carbon stock and NDVI values was found to be significant (r = 84 % for 2003 and 80 % for 2013) and was used for the spatial interpolation of carbon values in order to generate carbon map for the two time periods and the results of the analyses are presented.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2016,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Palchowdhuri, Y; Vyas, A; Kushwaha, D; Roy, A; Roy, PS",,,Py-GC-MS; E. camaldulensis; S/G ratio; NIR,GLOBULUS WOOD LIGNIN; ANALYTICAL PYROLYSIS; PY-GC/MS; COMPONENTS; ORIGINS; NIR,,"[Ramadevi, Payyavula; Hegde, Deepak V.; Varghese, Mohan; Kamalakannan, Rathinam; Ganapathy, Suraj P.; Gurumurthy, Demlapura S.] ITC LSTC, Peenya Ind Area, 3 1st Main,Phase1, Bangalore 560058, Karnataka, India","Ramadevi, P; Varghese, M (corresponding author), ITC LSTC, Peenya Ind Area, 3 1st Main,Phase1, Bangalore 560058, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2800,171,2801,Relationship between size hierarchy and density of trees in a tropical dry deciduous forest of western India,"Questions: Density dependence is thought to restrict exponential growth as well as give rise to size structure in populations. Size hierarchy in trees from tropical dry deciduous forests is studied to ask (1) whether nature of competition is symmetric or asymmetric and (2) what is the self thinning trajectory under a natural gradient of tree density. Location: Western India. Methods: Density was measured as the number of trees in 10-m radius circular plots (n = 96) and size was measured at DBH. Size variation was evaluated by the Gini coefficient (n = 1239 trees). Results: Size inequality between neighbours decreased with density but in a non-linear manner. In the backdrop of existing theory this indirectly suggests that competitive interactions may be symmetric over a 'depletive' resource such as below-ground water (rather than a 'pre-emptive' resource such as light), which is very plausible in a semi-arid environment. The self thinning coefficient derived from the relationship between stem diameter and density (y approximate to -1/4), is higher than expected from existing models of allometric plant growth (y approximate to -1/3) which are based on above-ground interactions alone. Seen in conjunction, these results suggest that above-ground structures, such as stem size, do not adequately represent the outcome of competitive interactions when below-ground resources, such as water, may be more important under semi-arid conditions. Conclusions: The non-linear relationship between size inequality and density indicates that there exists a density threshold beyond which investment in above-ground biomass becomes sluggish in semi-arid, deciduous forests. Since current allometric models do not incorporate below-ground biomass for trees, these data suggest that a more comprehensive allometric growth model may have higher predictive power and wider applicability.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2007.tb02551.x,2007,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Bagchi, S",,,anamorphic Clavicipitaceae; epizootic population; Hypocreales; mitochondrial ribosomal genes; parasexual cycle,BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA; METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; DIVERSITY; HAPLOTYPES; SPECIATION; PLASMIDS; PATTERNS,Andhra University; Tata Sons; Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS),"Andhra Univ, Dept Bot, Visakhapatnam 003, Andhra Pradesh, India; Geisenheim Res Ctr, Sect Phytomed, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; Ctr Adv Technol, Bioinformat Div, Tata Consultancy Serv, Hyderabad 500081, Andhra Pradesh, India","Devi, UK (corresponding author), Andhra Univ, Dept Bot, Visakhapatnam 530, Visakhapatnam 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and tannins in mature and young leaves of 12 major food species in the laboratory. Food selection is positively correlated with CP in winter and negatively correlated with ADF in both seasons. It also is correlated with CP/ADF ratio, but to a lesser extent than the best predictor in winter and spring. Selection ratio is not correlated with CP and ADF in both seasons.

For the last 2 decades the area has been facing immense pressure on its natural resources because of an increase in the numbers of tourists and the lack of effective regulation by park authorities. To assess this situation the study sites were categorized as closed canopy (CC) forest and open canopy (CC) forest (disturbed) at upper forest (UF) and lower forest (LF) sites, on the basis of firewood extraction pressure from the community and tourism enterprises. The results showed significant variations in diversity, richness, structure, productivity, and regeneration among different canopy types. CC forest showed greater plant diversity than CC forest. Firewood extraction pressure was remarkably greater in the LF near the major settlement than in the UF Local conservation initiatives and the interventions of an ecotourism project have had visible impacts on firewood use by the community and on tourism enterprises. Although alarming, the rate of woody biomass extraction was nonetheless lower than the annual productivity rate of the stands. Participatory management and compliance by tourism enterprises with a code of conduct on alternative fuel use along the trekking corridor would help promote the conservation and maintenance of biodiversity.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2002)022[0150:IOFEOT]2.0.CO;2,2002,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"Chettri, N; Sharma, E; Deb, DC; Sundriyal, RC",,,genetic variability; Wuchereria bancrofti; lymphatic filariasis; RAPD analysis,INFECTION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; RAPD,Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - Vector Control Research Center (VCRC),"ICMR, Vector Control Res Ctr, Pondicherry 605006, India","Kumar, NP (corresponding author), ICMR, Vector Control Res Ctr, Pondicherry 605006, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2921,178,2922,"Sacred groves of Manipur, northeast India: biodiversity value, status and strategies for their conservation","The people of Manipur, a state in northeast India, follow ancestral worship and animism in the form of deity worship, with the central focus on worship in forest patches. The beliefs and taboos associated with the Sylvan deities ( Umanglais) in the forest patches are restricted to any sort of disturbance of. ora and fauna. These social boundaries help to conserve the entire organism as a whole, which stand the concept of sacred groves. The pleasing of deities is performed every year by the Meiteis, a dominant community of Manipur, in honour of the deities and to gain their favour. Indigenous cultural and rituals practices of the local people in sacred groves serve as a tool for conserving biodiversity. Sacred groves are distributed over a wide ecosystem and help in conservation of rare and endemic species. Well- preserved sacred groves are store houses of valuable medicinal and other plants having high economic value, and serve as a refuge to threatened species. One hundred and sixty- six sacred groves were inventoried in Manipur valley that comprises Imphal east, Imphal west, Thoubal and Bishnupur districts of the state. Detailed studies were carried out in four selected sacred groves, to know the importance of biodiversity status and vegetation characteristics. A total of 173 plant species representing 145 genera under 70 families were recorded through baseline. floristic survey. The species diversity indices were compared among the four studied groves. The vegetation composition and community characteristics were recorded. Ethnobotanical uses of species were examined, which reveal that 96% of the species were used as medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Utilization of herbal medicine by the Meiteis is closely related to the cultural and ritual practices. A few of the medicinal plants which have disappeared from the locality are now confined only to the groves. Socio- cultural aspects were investigated taking into account the attitudes of local people, which indicate social beliefs and taboo are eroding, simultaneously degrading the degree of protection of sacred groves. Therefore, conservation measures of sacred groves need to be formulated considering the factor of degradation and the basic necessities of the local people. Until and unless a viable option is provided to the local people ( especially those who habitat nearby the adjoining areas) for sustaining their economic condition, no step for conservation of biodiversity will be successful.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-0530-5,2005,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Khumbongmayum, AD; Khan, ML; Tripathi, RS",,,biodiversity conservation; endemic and threatened species; medicinal plants; non-timber forest products; protected areas; sacred groves; Western Ghats of India,XERIC SUCCULENT THICKET; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL 200; CONSERVATION; FOREST; RESERVE; PERSPECTIVE; MANAGEMENT; DIVERSITY; PLANTS,Natural History Museum London; University of Oxford,"Nat Hist Museum, London SW7 5BD, England; Univ Oxford, Oxford, England","Bhagwat, SA (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,C0128,179,3355,Anthropogenic disturbances alter community structure in the forests of Kashmir Himalaya,"Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances are key drivers of forest dynamics that alter species composition and diversity, which in turn determine the successional trajectory of the forests. The present study aimed to investigate the community composition, population structure and regeneration status of tree species in relation to anthropogenic disturbances in temperate pure coniferous forests of Kashmir Himalaya. Comparable forest sites with varying degree of disturbance were selected and the regeneration status of the tree species was determined by measuring the population size of seedlings and saplings. The seedling, sapling and tree density were significantly greater in the less disturbed (LD) sites as compared to the highly disturbed sites (HD). Moreover, the LD sites showed highest frequency of lower tree girth classes, resulting in the formation of an inverse J-shaped curve, while as the HD sites showed unimodal distribution with maximum number of individuals in higher girth classes. Such a shift in forest structure from inverse J-shaped to unimodal distribution alters the niche space and facilitates the colonization of non-resident oak species (Quercus baloot, Q. incana), which otherwise are component of relatively low-altitude mixed temperate forests of the region. The results of the present study provide baseline ecological indicators in characterizing and quantifying the human-driven changes in forest composition and structure; and can help in developing scientifically-informed policy tools for the effective management and ecological restoration of human-modified forest landscapes in this Himalayan region.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2019,NA,"SM Haq, I Rashid, AA Khuroo, ZA Malik, AH Malik",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the regeneration status of all recorded tree species and anthropogenic disturbance of Sal forests were also studied. Girth class distribution showed a reverse J-shaped population curve in the present study, and there was a decline in tree density with an increase in girth class, and mature trees with higher girth (> 120 cm) were very few (9.30%), that signifies the ongoing natural regeneration as well as both natural and anthropogenic disturbances within the studied Sal forest stands. Out of the 103 recorded tree species, 50 species (48.54%) had shown the total absence of regeneration (no regeneration), while 23 species each (22.33%) showed poor and good regeneration, and rest 07 species (6.80%) showed fair regeneration in the studied Sal forests stand. On the other hand, the maximum studied Sal forest stands of Ranchi (42.39%) had shown fair regeneration of S. robusta followed by good regenerating forests (36.96%), and 17.39% forests showed no regeneration. Disturbance index had a weak statistically significant negative correlation with density (ind. ha−1) (r = − 0.20; P < 0.05), and tree basal area (m2 ha−1) (r = − 0.19; P < 0.05), while, it had a weak statistically significant positive correlation with Pielou’s evenness index (r = 0.19; P < 0.05). The growth, survival, and reproductive potential of all tree species will be at risk in the near future if the present trend of anthropogenic pressure continues.

,,,A1856,181,1857,Aboveground-Biomass Estimation of a Complex Tropical Forest in India Using Lidar,"Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) is a state of the art technology to assess forest aboveground biomass (AGB). To date, methods developed to relate Lidar metrics with forest parameters were built upon the vertical component of the data. In multi-layered tropical forests, signal penetration might be restricted, limiting the efficiency of these methods. A potential way for improving AGB models in such forests would be to combine traditional approaches by descriptors of the horizontal canopy structure. We assessed the capability and complementarity of three recently proposed methods for assessing AGB at the plot level using point distributional approach (DM), canopy volume profile approach (CVP), 2D canopy grain approach (FOTO), and further evaluated the potential of a topographical complexity index (TCI) to explain part of the variability of AGB with slope. This research has been conducted in a mountainous wet evergreen tropical forest of Western Ghats in India. AGB biomass models were developed using a best subset regression approach, and model performance was assessed through cross-validation. Results demonstrated that the variability in AGB could be efficiently captured when variables describing both the vertical (DM or CVP) and horizontal (FOTO) structure were combined. Integrating FOTO metrics with those of either DM or CVP decreased the root mean squared error of the models by 4.42% and 6.01%, respectively. These results are of high interest for AGB mapping in the tropics and could significantly contribute to the REDD+ program. Model quality could be further enhanced by improving the robustness of field-based biomass models and influence of topography on area-based Lidar descriptors of the forest structure.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs70810607,2015,REMOTE SENSING,"Vega, C; Vepakomma, U; Morel, J; Bader, JL; Rajashekar, G; Jha, CS; Feret, J; Proisy, C; Pelissier, R; Dadhwal, VK",,,Indoor photobioreactor; Chlamydomonas debaryana; Biomass; Nitrogen stress; Fatty acid profile,BIODIESEL PRODUCTION; CHLORELLA-VULGARIS; MICROALGAE; OIL; PYROLYSIS; ENERGY,National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar,"[Mishra, Sanjeev; Singh, Neetu; Sarma, Anil Kumar] Sardar Swaran Singh Natl Inst Renewable Energy, Kapurthala 144601, Punjab, India; [Singh, Neetu] Dr B R Ambedkar Natl Inst Technol, Jalandhar 144011, Punjab, India","Mishra, S (corresponding author), Sardar Swaran Singh Natl Inst Renewable Energy, 12KM Stone,Jalandhar Kapurthala Rd, Kapurthala 144601, Punjab, India.",SSS-NIRE,,,,,,,,,,

These plants are used by the Indian traditional healers for the past many centuries to treat various ailments such as skin disorders, asthma, diabetes, snake bite, fever, pain, eye diseases, diarrhoea, indigestion, jaundice, burn, wound, liver disorder, CNS disorders and urinary tract infection. The indigenous traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and therapies of various local communities has been lost due to changes in traditional culture and the introduction of modern technologies. Therefore, it is essential to explore the traditional knowledge of the indigenous medicinal plants mainly in such areas where there is a severe threat to natural vegetation owing to human inhabitation. The present study aimed to explore the medicinal plants of Chakrata region (Jaunsar-Bawar Hills), Uttarakhand, India used in the folk medicine for the management of diabetes by Jaunsari Tribe. In a comprehensive field survey, the information about the medicinal plants have been mainly collected from the traditional healers and other elderly people belong to the tribal community. All the information about the medicinal plants of the study area was documented in a field book. Various tools have been used to collect the samples for identification purpose and the authentication of the plants was done with the help of taxonomists. The literature on these plants was also searched from online (PubMed and Scopus) as well as from some textbooks and Ayurvedic classical texts. The present survey-based work described a total of 54 plants belonging to 47 genera and 30 families used in the traditional medicine for the management of diabetes in Chakrata region. The information gathered from the local community revealed that the plants are effective in diabetes and one can use most of them without consulting a practitioner or traditional healer. The literature revealed that most of the surveyed plants are already used in the preparation of various antidiabetic formulations such as Chandraprabha vati, Nishamalaki chunra, Amritamehari churna and Nisakathakadi kashayam along with various patent drugs which are frequently prescribed by the Ayurvedic practitioners in India. The present study explored the traditional as well as scientific knowledge on the antidiabetic plants used by the tribal community.

The study evaluated community structure, biodiversity, Technosol quality, and carbon (C) dynamics in the post-mining ecosystem (PME). The multivariate statistical tool was used to identify the key soil properties, and soil quality was evaluated byusing Technosol quality index (TQI). One unreclaimed site (0years) and four chronosequences revegetated coal mine sites (3, 7, 10, and 15years) were studied and compared with an undisturbed forest as a reference site. Plant biodiversity indices [Shannon index of diversity (2.42) and Pielou's evenness (0.97) and Patric richness (12)] were highest in 15-year-old revegetated sites.

Unlike classic catenas, lower elevation soils had lesser moisture, plant-available Ca, Cu, Mn, Mg, Zn, B, clay and total C. The distribution of plant-available Ca, Cu, Mn and Mg appeared to largely be determined by the whole-rock chemical composition differences between amphibolites and hornblende-biotite gneisses. Amphibolites were associated with summit positions, while gneisses dominated lower elevations, an observation that concurs with other studies in the region which suggest that hillslope-scale topography has been shaped by differential weathering of lithologies. Neither NO3--N nor NH4+-N was explained by the basal area of trees belonging to Fabaceae, a family associated with N-fixing species, and no long-term effects of fire on soil parameters were detected.

,,,A2489,190,2490,Biodiversity conservation and livelihoods in human-dominated landscapes: Forest commons in South Asia,"Strict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho = .41, p < 0.001, N = 59). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.

However, urbanization has largely destroyed the original native ecosystems and has caused a homogenization where frequently native species are replaced by non-native species. When attempting to understand the role of trees in urban settings, it is important to generate science-based data on the spatial distribution of trees, their species composition and tree species diversity as a function of the degree of urbanization. Such information may specifically inform the planning of effective long-term management of trees across urban and rural gradients. A total of 23 of 1 ha each were surveyed along a Northern research transect laid out along the urbanâ€“rural gradient of the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India. Plots were randomly selected from the stratum â€œsettlement areasâ€, where WorldView-3 imagery supported both stratification and plot selection. The plots were fully mapped for trees, where a total of eleven variables had been observed for each tree. In addition, the basal area and wood volume was calculated to understand the biomass potential of the trees in the plots. The diversity indices such as the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielouâ€™s evenness and Margalefâ€™s richness were considered for comparing the species diversity, composition and distribution along the gradient of Bengaluru. A total of 1128 individuals of 93 tree species were recorded. Among 92 species identified along the northern gradient, 53 are exotic, and 39 are native species. The Shannonâ€“Wiener index varied from 1.33 to 2.72; Simpsonâ€™s index varied from 0.65 to 0.90; Pielouâ€™s index varied from 0.66 to 0.90, and Margalefâ€™s index ranged from 1.41 to 5.20 along the gradient. The basal area increased from 96.39 m2 to 102.76 m2 from 2017 to 2019 along the transect, with a net gain of 6.37 m2. Similarly, the wood volume increased from 1819.57 m3 to 1926.23 m3 with a net gain of 106.66 m3. The present study reports on tree distribution, species composition and tree species diversity along a gradient from the city center to the rural surroundings of northern parts of Bengaluru city. The information generated may support the city planners/administrators by providing a holistic understanding of the species composition and abundance for a further selection of adaptive species and appropriate tree and vegetation management practices to conserve the existing green spaces and contribute towards sustainable urban planning. The sample plots laid out may also serve as permanent observation plots for monitoring the dynamics of tree cover in the city.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031295,2022,SUSTAINABILITY,"Divakara, BN; Nikitha, CU; Noelke, N; Tewari, VP; Kleinn, C",,,Sentinel-2; Landsat-8; Satellite indices; Urban area,LAND-COVER; WATER INDEXES; SENTINEL-2; LANDSAT-8; IMAGERY; FOREST; NDWI; MSI,National Institute of Technology (NIT System); National Institute of Technology Raipur; Gayatri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering; Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo,"[Prasad, A.

This habitat destruction threatens the survival of many species. This study examined the demographic instability of tree species in 3-ha permanent plots: at five sites differing in the degree of disturbance. Based on the proportion of seedlings of a species in its total population (seedling + sapling + adults), about 52% of the total 65 species exhibited local demographic instability, and at one or more sites a single individual represented 10 species. The increase in the proportion of declining species with increase in disturbance intensity indicated that local anthropogenic pressure is responsible for the depletion.

(1) What is the impact of mesoclimatic gradients and dispersal limitation on phylogenetic turnover and species turnover? (2) How does phylogenetic turnover between continents compare in intensity with the turnover driven by climatic gradients at a regional scale? (3) Are independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niche of clades congruent between continents? Location Panama Canal Watershed and Western Ghats (India), two anciently divergent biogeographic contexts but with comparable rainfall gradients. Methods Using floristic data for 50 1-ha plots in each region, independent measures of phylogenetic turnover (?ST) and species turnover (Jaccard) between plots were regressed on geographic and ecological distances. Mesoclimatic niches were reconstructed for each node of the phylogeny and compared between the two continents. Results (1) The phylogenetic turnover within each region is best explained by mesoclimatic differences (environmental filtering), while species turnover depends both on mesoclimatic differences and geographic distances (dispersal limitation). (2) The phylogenetic turnover between continents (?ST = 0.009) is comparable to that caused by mesoclimatic gradients within regions (?ST = 0.010) and both effects seem cumulative. (3) Independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niches were strongly correlated between the two continents (r = 0.61), despite the absence of shared species. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate a world-wide deep phylogenetic signal for mesoclimatic niche within a biome, indicating that positive phylogenetic turnover at a regional scale reflects environmental filtering in plant communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00742.x,2012,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Hardy, OJ; Couteron, P; Munoz, F; Ramesh, BR; Pelissier, R",,Data from Ramesh et al.

,,,A0357,194,358,Long-Term Impact of Transhumance Pastoralism and Associated Disturbances in High-Altitude Forests of Indian Western Himalaya,"The Himalayan Mountains are geodynamical important, featuring a wide climatic range with a rich diversity of flora, fauna, human communities, culture, and social set-up. In recent decades, due to constant anthropogenic pressure and considerable changes witnessed in the climate of the region, species of this region are threatened. Here, we assessed the impact of nomadic settlement and associated disturbances on plant species composition, diversity parameters, ecosystem properties, and fire incidence in high-altitude forests of Western Himalaya, India. Based on the distance between nomadic settlement location and forest, we classified forest as near nomadic settlement (NNS) or away nomadic settlement (ANS) forest types. We found a significant variation in plant species composition between forest types. Three species, namely, Sibbaldia cuneata, Poa annua, and Abies pindrow, contribute 25% of the cumulative variation in plant species composition. Studying live plants, we found a significant difference only for density, in which ANS had a higher average density than NNS. Considering dead plants, we found a significant difference in all nine plant-related parameters evaluated between sites. NNS had a higher value of all parameters evaluated, except for height, which was higher in ANS sites. ANS forest type show 1.3 times more average carbon stock (160.39 Â± 59.03 MgChaâˆ’1; mean Â± SD) than NNS forest type (120.40 Â± 51.74 MgChaâˆ’1). We found a significant difference in plant diversity evaluated between forest types. ANS had higher values of Margalef and Fisher diversity but lower values of evenness. We found that NSS had significantly higher values of fire incidences, whereas ANS has a higher normalized differential vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index. Overall, our study showed that species composition, diversity, and fire incidence are strongly impacted due to nomadic settlements. These findings are paramount for designing appropriate livelihood options for indigenous communities and management policies of the long-term forest harvest to achieve global goals and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration targets (2021â€“2030) to protect the sustainable development of forest mountainous regions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.3390/su132212497,2021,SUSTAINABILITY,"Haq, SM; Yaqoob, U; Calixto, ES; Kumar, M; Rahman, IU; Hashem, A; Abd Allah, EF; Alakeel, MA; Alqarawi, AA; Abdalla, M; Lone, FA; Khan, MA; Khan, U; Ijaz, F",,,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; lineage diversity; evolutionary dynamics; virus bioinformatics; India; variant of concern; variant of interest; spike; phylogeny,DATAMONKEY; NUCLEOTIDE; BINDING; PROTEIN,Savitribai Phule Pune University; Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC); Savitribai Phule Pune University,"[Limaye, Sanket; Kasibhatla, Sunitha M.; Kinikar, Meenal; Kulkarni-Kale, Urmila] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ Formerly Univ Pune, Bioinformat Ctr, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India; [Kasibhatla, Sunitha M.] Ctr Dev Adv Comp, HPC Med & Bioinformat Applicat Grp, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Ramtirthkar, Mukund; Kale, Mohan M.] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ Formerly Univ Pune, Dept Stat, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Kulkarni-Kale, U (corresponding author), Savitribai Phule Pune Univ Formerly Univ Pune, Bioinformat Ctr, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.","Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt. of India under the BTIS program [BT/PR40171/BTIS/137/21/2021]","Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast Indiaâ€™s diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha âˆ’1 , respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), subtropical forests (106.01Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), tropical forests (105.33 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), tropical plantations (93.00Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), and temperate plantations (50.10 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45Â cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), followed by temperate forests (63.4Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) and subtropical forests (42.58Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 , respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.724950,2021,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Sahoo, UK; Tripathi, OP; Nath, AJ; Deb, S; Das, DJ; Gupta, A; Devi, NB; Charturvedi, SS; Singh, SL; Kumar, A; Tiwari, BK",,,canopy science; community ecology; mixed-effects model; logging; single rope technique; vascular epiphyte; conservation; Western Ghats,MUNDANTHURAI-TIGER-RESERVE; WET EVERGREEN FOREST; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MONTANE FOREST; SPECIES RICHNESS; LOWLAND FOREST; TREE SIZE; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"[Seshadri, K.

The total ecosystem carbon density was 247.87 t ha(-1). Carbon partitioning in different components of the chir pine forest ecosystem were ranked in the order of soil layer (190.89 t ha(-1)) > vegetation layer (51.13 t ha(-1)) > detritus (5.85 t ha(-1)). More carbon was recorded in soil than vegetation with a soil: vegetation ratio of 4.4. Less carbon stock in vegetation and detritus may be attributed to the fact that in the Indian Himalayan region, the dependency of communities on forests is causing their over exploitation and degradation.

Impact on floristic diversity and population structure in a thorn scrub forest","Impact of extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was analyzed irt a thorn scrub forest in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) wildlife sanctuary India. Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes bl vegetation structure are still occuring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those >7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community, itself may. be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02862149,1998,ECONOMIC BOTANY,"Shankar, U; Murali, KS; Shaanker, RU; Ganeshaiah, KN; Bawa, KS",,,dry deciduous forest; NTFP extraction; wind dispersal; animal dispersal; Soliga,IMPACT,University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, Dept Crop Physiol, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Tata Energy Res Inst, Bangalore 560052, Karnataka, India","Bawa, KS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,

The combined approach was applied on a regional scale taking Himachal Pradesh (India), as a case study, with a hierarchy of forest strata representing the forest structure found in India. Biophysical modeling implemented revealed power regression model as the best fit (R (2) = 0.82) to model the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and biomass which was further implemented to calculate multi-temporal above ground biomass and carbon sequestration.

We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests.

,,,A0074,204,75,"Use of TanDEM-X PolInSAR for canopy height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western Ghats, India","Canopy height is a critical parameter in quantifying the vertical structure of forests. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) is a radar remote sensing technique that makes use of polarimetric separation of scattering phase centers obtained from interferometry to estimate height. This article discusses the potential of the X-band PolInSAR pair for forest height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western ghats. A total of 19 fully polarimetric datasets with various spatial baselines acquired from November 2015 to February 2016 in bistatic mode are utilized in this study. After compensating for all possible non-volumetric decorrelations in the data-sets, the remaining volume decorrelation is modeled using a Random Volume Over Ground (RVoG) model to invert height from PolInSAR data. A modified three-stage algorithm developed by Cloude and Papathanassiou ( 2003 ) is adopted for height inversion. PolInSAR derived heights were cross-validated against reference height data measured during a field survey conducted in March 2019. RMSE values of all TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X PolInSAR heights with respect to field measured heights range from 3.3 to 13.8 m and the correlation coefficient r 2 varies between 0.16 and 0.79. The results suggest that the use of a dataset with optimal wavenumber can improve the tree height estimation process. The best performance was achieved for the dataset acquired on 11 December 2015 with RMSE = 3.4 m and r 2 = 0.79. Furthermore, the effects of parameters such as angle of incidence, precipitation, and forest biomass on height inversion accuracy are assessed. A large-scale Shimoga Forest height map was generated using multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions with the best correlation results. To improve the accuracy of the height estimation, a merged height approach is explored. The best height estimates among all PolInSAR estimates for a given field plot are chosen in this regard. The merged height approach gave rise to an improved inversion accuracy with RMSE = 1.9 m and r 2 = 0.92.

The number of tree species per unit area at the sapling stage was highest on Interview Island; however at the tree stage, Interview Island had the lowest number of species. There were no differences in the number of trees in each girth class between the sites. Heavy browsing on seedlings was noted at the sites that had introduced herbivores.

We tested whether stem densities, dominance, the prevalence of rarity, and the proportion of understorey trees are significantly correlated with alpha diversity. Locatiaon The WG is a chain of mountains c. 1600 km in length, running parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula from above 8degrees N to almost 21degrees N latitude. Wet forests occur as a narrow strip in regions with heavy rainfall. Methods To assess tree diversity we used data from 40 small plots, < 1 ha in area, where all trees greater than or equal to 3.18 cm d.b.h. had been inventoried. These plots were distributed across 7 latitudinal degrees and at elevations between 200 and 1550 m. Fisher's alpha was used as a measure of diversity. For each plot, the proportion of trees belonging to the understorey, the proportion of trees belonging to the most abundant species in the plot, as a measure of dominance, and the proportionate representation of singletons, as a measure of rarity, were estimated, and correlated with Fisher's alpha, elevation, rainfall and seasonality. Results Annual rainfall and seasonality increased towards the north, but were not significantly correlated. Tree diversity increased significantly with decreasing seasonality. Tree diversity was not significantly correlated with stem density or with the proportion of understorey tree species, but was significantly correlated with tree dominance and rarity. Dominance increased and rarity significantly decreased with increasing seasonality. Main conclusions This study demonstrates that seasonality influences rain forest tree diversity in the WG of India. The relationship between alpha diversity, dominance and rarity lends correlative support for the Janzen-Connell pest pressure hypothesis.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01165.x,2005,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Davidar, P; Puyravaud, JP; Leigh, EG",,,basal area; biomass; diversity indices; forest community; importance value index; sodic soil; soil amelioration; species richness; vegetation strata,DRY TROPICAL FOREST; PLANT-SPECIES-DIVERSITY; SECONDARY SUCCESSION; DYNAMICS; BIOMASS; RECLAMATION,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI),"Natl Bot Res Inst, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India","Singh, B (corresponding author), Natl Bot Res Inst, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1687,210,1688,Changes in the dry tropical forests in Central India with human use,"Understanding changes in forest composition and structure is important to help formulate effective policies that promote future ability of forests to provide local livelihood needs, habitat and ecosystem services. This is particularly important in dry tropical forests that are ecologically different from other forests and are heavily used by local, forest-dependent residents. In this study, we identify biophysical, demographic and use factors associated with differences in species diversity, vegetation structure (abundance at different size classes), biomass and relative abundance of species across the Kanha-Pench landscape in Central India. We sampled vegetation in twenty transects across different human and livestock population densities and frequencies of use. We found that biomass, species diversity and vegetation (abundance at different size classes) are negatively associated with increasing population density, and species composition at different size classes is significantly different at higher frequencies of use at low population densities. Lack of difference in species composition at high population densities may be due to colonization and growth of individuals at some of these sites due to creation of new ecological niches and gaps at high human use. Relative abundance of species at different size classes also varies with frequency of use and population density. Results suggest that human use is altering relative abundance of species, which may change long-term forest composition and thus alter biomass and vegetation structure of the forest. We conclude that human use is an agent in altering long-term composition that can alter availability of tree species for local use and other ecosystem services.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0903-1,2016,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,"Agarwala, M; DeFries, RS; Qureshi, Q; Jhala, YV",,,Remote Sensing; GIS; Uranium Exploration; Mahakoshal Fold Belt; Son Valley; Madhya Pradesh,CENTRAL INDIA; EASTERN INDIA; MINERALIZATION; GEOCHRONOLOGY; GEOCHEMISTRY; METAMORPHISM; BASKATI; ZONE,Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research (AMD),"[Dwivedi, A.

The major threats to the existing patches are anthropogenic activities such as encroachment of forest area, mining, extraction of forest resources, grazing and forest fire. The present study was carried out at Jarain and adjoining areas of Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, northeast India to identify the current human disturbances and assess the floristic composition and structure of subtropical broad leaved forest along a fragment size gradient. Floristic sampling was carried out by laying 24 plots (20mx100m) across 10 forest fragments covering a sampled area of 4.8 ha. A total of 160 woody species (>= 5cm dbh) belonging to 105 genera and 54 families were enumerated from all the studied fragments. The species richness was 69 in Small, 75 in Medium, 76 in Very Large (VL) and 77 in Large (L) fragment classes. In this study, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between area, disturbance and phytosociological attributes. The results showed that the stand density increased (r = 0.71, p=0.01), while basal area decreased with disturbance (r =- 0.74, p=0.01). The density was high in 5-15cm dbh class that gradually declined with the increase in diameter. The basal area was high in >66cm dbh class in Very Large fragments whereas in small patches, the values were higher in 16-25cm dbh classes. The forests fragments under study also have a number of rare, endemic and threatened species.

A comparative assessment has been made between two small watersheds in terms of their landscape structure (woody species composition) with soil water properties and availability of water in the respective downstream villages. The result shows that, sacred site with more primeval vegetation has close association with soil moisture in comparison to non-sacred site during dry spell of the year. The higher soil moisture ensures year long availability of water in the downstream village of the sacred site which facilitates farming of commercial crops with higher economic returns to the farmers, unlike the farmers in the other village where they face water crisis during the lean season.

This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900 ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.

Indian Remote Sensing satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS III and field sampling were used to model biological richness at 1: 50,000 scale. It was found that the sanctuary is dominated by Sal mixed dry deciduous forest. The vegetation map prepared through visual interpretation of satellite imagery was subjected to landscape analysis and assessment of biotic disturbance using SPLAM software. The disturbance index together with species richness, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and total importance value was modeled to access the biological richness in the sanctuary.

In recent years, the KL isÂ experiencing threats to biodiversity due to theÂ biological overdominance of native Maling bamboo ( Yushania maling ). In the present study, we investigated the impacts of the overdominance of Y. maling on the forest composition of Singalila National Park (SNP), Eastern Himalaya, India. Elevational habitats 2400 to 3400Â m asl were sampled by laying 69 (10Â m Ã— 10Â m) forest plots including 51 bamboo plots and 18 non-bamboo plots. Bamboo plots showed significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) low species richness and density in both shrub and herb layers which further manifested the low seedling density. Generalized Additive Model (GAM) estimated a significant (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) decline in species richness and density with increasing bamboo density in SNP. Our study projects the overdominance of Y. maling has a significant negative impact on forest structure and composition. Therefore, management of invasiveness of Y. maling is essential through its optimized removal from the protected areasÂ and utilization in makingÂ handicrafts, paper industries etc. to create ecological and economic benefits. Further long-term studies assessing the impacts of Y. maling overdominance on forest ecosystems and soil dynamics are recommended.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08483-8,2022,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Gaira, KS; Pandey, A; Sinha, S; Badola, HK; Lepcha, J; Dhyani, PP; Chettri, N",,,biochar; land degradation; microbial activity; SOC management; tropical alkaline soil,CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION; WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION; SEQUESTRATION; MINERALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MATTER; STABILIZATION; DECOMPOSITION,Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"[Seki, Mayuko; Sugihara, Soh; Tanaka, Haruo] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Miyazaki, Hidetoshi] Global Environm Forum, Tokyo, Japan; [Jegadeesan, Muniandi; Kannan, Pandian] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Bertrand, Isabelle] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, UMR Eco&Sols, INRAE,CIRAD,IRD, Montpellier, France","Sugihara, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.","SUMITOMO Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [17H06171, 17K19308, 18H02315, 20H03113, 20J13165]; TOBITATE!

In the upper Nilgiris of southern India, montane swamps are restricted to geographic areas with flat surfaces and bounded by different edge transition vegetation types including grasslands and shola forests. Our study examined whether species richness, endemism, edge and the composition of swamp interior communities have a significant relationship with swamp area. Using species-area curves we continued sampling for species in each swamp until species richness reached the asympote within that swamp. Our results suggest that species richness (log n), log endemism, and edge and swamp interior species composition do not increase significantly with increasing area due to edge effect. Moreover, swamp area and vegetation parameters showed no significant relationships. However our results did indicate that swamps species richness and endemism were affected by abiotic and biotic edge effects, particularly physical topographic environment and the structure of adjoining matrix vegetation. Therefore swamp protection and restoration, in addition to the preservation and management of buffer regions may be important conservation criteria to preserve these fragile ecosystems.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1204_909929,2014,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Mohandass, D; Puyravaud, JP; Hughes, AC; Davidar, P; Ganesh, PS; Campbell, M",,,diabetes mellitus; gestational diabetes mellitus; non-communicable diseases; pregnancy; prevalence,RISK-FACTORS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CHINESE WOMEN; SOUTH-INDIA; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; CONSENSUS; SERVICES; SCENARIO; GLUCOSE,University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"[Kanguru, Lovney; Hussein, Julia; Bell, Jacqueline] Univ Aberdeen, IMMPACT, Sch Med & Dent, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Bezawada, Navya] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med, Sch Med & Dent, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland","Kanguru, L (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, IMMPACT, Sch Med & Dent, 2nd Floor,Hlth Sci Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

In particular, there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure. Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure, diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future forest management planning.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892905002316,2005,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Kumar, R; Shahabuddin, G",,,non-timber forest products; NTFP; people's participation; conservation priority; sustainable use; southern India,,TERI University,"Habitat Ctr, Energy & Resources Inst TERI, New Delhi, India","Silori, CS (corresponding author), So Reg Ctr, Energy & Resources Inst TERI, 4th Main,2nd Cross,Domlur 2nd Stage, Bangalore 560071, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Recovery of rainforest bird community structure and composition, in relation to forest succession after slash-and-burn shifting cultivation or jhum was studied in Mizoram, north-east India. Replicate fallow sites abandoned after shifting cultivation 1, 5, 10, 25 and approximate to 100 years ago, were compared with primary evergreen and semi-evergreen forest using transect and quadrat sampling. 2, Vegetation variables such as woody plant species richness, tree density and vertical stratification increased with fallow age in a rapid. nun-linear, asymptotic manner. Principal components analysis of vegetation variables summarized 92.8% of the variation into two axes: PC1 reflecting forest development and woody plant succession (variables such as tree density, woody plant species richness), and PC2 depicting bamboo density, which increased from 1 to 25 years and declined thereafter. 3, Bird species richness, abundance and diversity, increased rapidly and asymptotically during succession paralleling vegetation recovery as shown by positive correlations with fallow age and PC1 scores of sites. Bamboo density reflected by PC2 had a negative effect on bird species richness and abundance. 4, The bird community similarity (Morisita index) of sites with primary forest also increased asymptotically with fallow age indicating sequential species turnover during succession. Bird community similarity of sites with primary forest (or between sites) was positively correlated with both physiognomic and floristic similarities with primary forest (or between sites). 5. The number of bird species in guilds associated with forest development and woody plants (canopy insectivores, frugivores: bark feeders) was correlated with PCI scores of the sites. Species in other guilds (e. g. granivores, understorey insectivores) appeared to dominate during early and mid-succession. 6, The non-linear relationships imply that fallow periods less than a threshold of 25 years for birds, and about 50-75 years for woody plants, are likely to cause substantial community alteration. 7, As 5-10-year rotation periods or jhum cycles prevail in many parts of north-east India. there is a need to protect and conserve tracts of late-successional and primary forest.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.00297.x,1998,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Raman, TRS; Rawat, GS; Johnsingh, AJT",,,alpha-diversity; beta-diversity; non-parametric estimator; rare species; Simpson's index; topography; tropical forest,TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; POPULATION-SIZE; INDEXES,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; VetAgro Sup,"Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie Genet & Biol Populat, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Inst Francais Pondichery, Pondicherry 605001, India","Gimaret-Carpentier, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie Genet & Biol Populat, CNRS, UMR 5558, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",,,,,,,,,,,

A study on secondary Succession was conducted in agricultural fallows around Puducherry, India to review the negative image of 'wastelands'. Chronosequences of four sites aged 2, 4, 10 and 50 years were used to investigate change in species composition and abundance, convergence with a nearby forest and to examine their economic use. A comparison of life-forms, species richness and diversity indices showed that herbaceous species dominated up to 10th year sere, from which point in succession, woody species became more common. It was in the 50th year sere that shrubs and secondary tree species occurring in nucleated clumps became dominant. A cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis similarity index shows a sequential development of vegetation through time, though 50th year plots showed no convergence with the Tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF), but the principal component analysis demonstrates a change in community structure from grasslands to shrub and secondary tree species' dominance. Presence of adults of five primary forest species found in the clumps indicates a fast rate of secondary succession, considering that grazing and resource removal occurred in the sites. The potential value of the 'wastelands' is evident from the fact that 64 per cent of recorded species have economic use, which underlines the need for their sustainable utilization for better management of bioresources rather than converting them into monocultures.

The undisturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands were identified within the sacred grove on the basis of canopy cover, light interception and tree ( cbh greater than or equal to 15 cm) density. The undisturbed forest stand had > 40% canopy cover,> 50% light interception and a density of 2103 trees per hectare, whereas the highly disturbed stand had,< 10% canopy cover, <10% light interception and 852 trees per hectare. The moderately disturbed stand occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. The study revealed that the mild disturbance favoured species richness, but with increased degree of disturbance, as was the case in the highly disturbed stand, the species richness markedly decreased. The number of families of angiosperms was highest ( 63) in the undisturbed stand, followed by the moderately ( 60) and highly disturbed ( 46) stands. The families Rubiaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae were the dominant families in the sacred forest. Rubiaceae was represented by 11, 14 and 10 species in the undisturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands, respectively, whilst the family Asteraceae had 16 species in the moderately disturbed stand and 14 species in the highly disturbed stand. The number of families represented by a single species was reduced significantly from 33 in the undisturbed stand to 23 in the moderately and 21 in the highly disturbed stand. The similarity index was maximum ( 71%) between the undisturbed and moderately disturbed stand and minimum ( 33%) between the undisturbed and highly disturbed stands. The Margalef index, Shannon diversity index and evenness index exhibited a similar trend, with highest values in the moderately disturbed stand. In contrast, the Simpson dominance index was highest in the highly disturbed stand. There was a sharp decline in tree density and basal area from the undisturbed ( 2103 trees ha(-1) and 26.9 m(2) ha(-1)) to the moderately disturbed ( 1268 trees ha(-1) and 18.6 m(2) ha(-1)) and finally to the highly disturbed ( 852 trees ha(-1) and 7.1 m(2) ha(-1)) stand. Density - girth curves depicted a successive reduction in number of trees in higher girth classes from the undisturbed to the moderately and highly disturbed stands.

Enumeration of all tree stands >= 10 cm GBH (girth at breast height) equivalent to 3.18 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) yielded a total of 2843 individuals ranging from 2 to 223 individuals per plot (0.1 ha) belonging to 132 species, 118 genera and 63 families. Euphorbiaceae was the dominant family in the forest with 12 species, 11 genera and family important value index (FIV) of 42.7. Tree stand density, species richness, diversity index and basal area were found to be highest in evergreen forest and least in mixed moist deciduous forest. We carried out spatial analysis of spread of species richness, basal area, tree density, and tree biodiversity. We found higher basal area, tree density and biodiversity in protected areas of the region. This demonstrates the conservation value of protected areas in the region. Schima wallichii (280 individuals), Macaranga denticulata (275 individuals) and Michelia oblonga (238 individuals) were some of predominant species having species important values (SIV) 26.48, 17.36, 14.41, respectively, representing all together 28% of the total tree stand density. The total basal area from all the sampling plots was 254.62 m(2) out of which, the highest contribution of 64.80 m(2) ha(-1) (50%) was by evergreen forest and lowest, 22.43 m(2) ha(-1) (17%) was contributed by deciduous forest. At the species level, Schima wallichi has contributed 13% of the total basal area. The smaller 10-20 cm diameter class showed maximum tree density implying regenerating forest and highest basal area (9.80 m(2) ha(-1)) for overall study site. However, in evergreen forest 40-50 cm diameter class exhibited highest basal area of 64.80 m(2) ha(-1) and greater diversity (4.06) leading to higher stability of the community.

Plant communities were identified with the help of satellite imagery and ground data, and community wise diversity was estimated. Analysis of landscape matrices using satellite images and GIS tools showed deforestation of smaller fragments, and fragmentation and degradation of larger ones. Fragments of smaller size had lesser number of plant communities compared to larger fragments. Generally large size fragments were species rich and more diverse as compared to smaller fragments. Lagestoemia-Acacia-Lannea community was richest for both tree and herb strata, whereas Shorea-Buchanania community was the richest when all vascular flora were considered. The study indicates that species rich communities of the dry tropical forests are not only being reduced in area but they are also becoming species poof and less diverse due to rapid deforestation and forest fragmentation. The communities most vulnerable to alien invasive plants were Acacia-Terminalia, Terminalia-Shorea and Hardwickia-Acacia.

Tree population, composition and diversity particularly in the temperate Himalaya play a key role in the maintenance of many ecosystem services and natural biogeochemical cycles. The present study explores composition and regeneration status of tree species in a temperate mixed forest in Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary, East Sikkim, India.Â Two sites at an elevation range of 2800â€“3800 m were selected and 20 plots of 20 m Ã— 20 m for trees, 80 plots of 5 m Ã— 5 m for saplings, and 160 plots of 1 m Ã— 1 m for seedlings were sampled to study the regeneration status. A total of 17 tree species belonging to 9 genera and 8 families were recorded of which Rhododendron was the most dominant genus with maximum number of species. All the phytosociological attributes, such as relative density, abundance and important value index were calculated. The average species richness of adult trees and saplings was 13.5Â± 0.7 and for seedlings it was 12.5 Â± 0.07.

strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the timber volume
and biomass, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial
coverage afforded by remote sensing. The present study aims to estimate the above ground tree
biomass (AGB) of forest cover in Khuldia wildlife sanctuary, Balasore district, Orissa, by
combining field inventoried data and multispectral satellite image. We coupled AGB values,
calculated from field measurements of tree diameter at breast height (dbh), with spectral
information derived from IRS P6 LISS-III sensor data through linear regression analyses to
produce an initial biomass map. We found that AGB estimates were strongly related to red
reflectance (r2=0.85 and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; r2=0.69). Our AGB
results are comparable to previously reported values. The total amount of AGB in the study area
(272.75 sq.km.) was estimated as 5353.70 Giga tons and ranged from 75 to 338 Mg/ha with an
average of 196 and a standard deviation of 45 Mg/ha. The AGB class with the highest percentage
(32.1%) was between 250 and 300 Mg/ha. Forests with biomass values 300 to 338 Mg/ha
accounted for less than 10% of the study area and were usually associated with mature trees.

,,,A2875,241,2876,Seed size: a key trait determining species distribution and diversity of dry tropical forest in northern India,"The study examined the relationships among seed size, plant distribution and abundance in a dry tropical forest of northern India. Results indicated that small-seeded species, which were generally wind-dispersed, were more widely distributed, at this local scale, compared to large-seeded species. However, the proportional abundance and basal cover of seed size categories indicated that the structure of the dry forest was largely determined by the medium- to large-seeded species. There was a considerable amount of redundancy within each seed size group, which added to the species diversity. Variability in seed size and the variable degree of shade-tolerance permit the species to occupy the full range of the gradient of light environments of the forest floor. This study revealed that in little to moderately disturbed locations seedlings of large-seeded species increased in abundance, whereas in extremely perturbed locations seedlings of species with medium-sized to small seeds were more abundant.

extraction of these resources can result in the loss of biodiversity. To assess the impact of resource extraction
on forest vegetation, we conducted a study in the dry deciduous forests adjoining the eastern boundary of the
Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the southern western ghats, India. Using 8, 1–ha plots where all
woody species ≥3.18 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) were permanently marked with tags, we estimated
the number of fresh cuttings on branches and stems at 3–month intervals over a period of 2 years. We used
these data to estimate the extraction pressure: [(total number of cuts*100/total number of plants in the plot)/
3] to give monthly percentages for each village. We compared vegetation structure, diversity, basal area and
regeneration in sites with heavy human pressure to control plots where there was no current extraction. On
average, branches and stems from 10% of plants in a hectare of forest were pruned or cut every month.
However, the mean % of branches and stems pruned or cut per month declined from 15% to 8% over the 2
year study period. There was lower species richness, species diversity, and mean height of trees in the
disturbed site, when compared with the undisturbed sites. The basal area and regeneration of plants were
also lower in the disturbed sites. Very few of the species extracted by villagers regenerated in the disturbed
sites. This suggests that resource extraction is non-sustainable within the protected area and will eventually
lead to loss of biodiversity and degradation of the forest.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2005,NA,"M Arjunan, JP Puyravaud, P Davidar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of degree of fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees, lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly modified agricultural landscape, and have been preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities. Plants were sampled at two sites in continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60 species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were recorded. Trees exhibited a significant species-area relationship (R (2) = 0.74). Richness estimates after controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed that observed species-area relationship was not an artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species richness of the other three groups was explained by stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance from the reserve forest did not explain any variation in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area gradient while nestedness in the other three groups showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness. The four life forms thus responded variably to degree of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the regional diversity for trees was contributed by diversity among plots, highlighting the importance of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the total regional species pool. We conclude that trees alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9638-8,2010,PLANT ECOLOGY,"Page, NV; Qureshi, Q; Rawat, GS; Kushalappa, CG",,,Dairy industry wastewater; Moringa oleifera; Biosorption; Natural adsorbent,AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; REMOVAL; COAGULATION; MECHANISM; SORPTION; PROTEIN; POWDER; SYSTEM; IONS,Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Federal de Sergipe,"[Salcedo Vieira, Angelica Marquetotti; Vieira, Marcelo F.; Bergamasco, Rosangela] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Chem Engn, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Silva, Gabriel F.; Araujo, Alvaro A.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Chem Engn, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, Sergipe, Brazil; [Fagundes-Klen, Marcia R.; Veit, Marcia T.] W Parana State Univ Toledo, Dept Chem Engn, BR-85903000 Toledo, Parana, Brazil","Vieira, AMS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Chem Engn, Av Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9502-5,2009,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Ambinakudige, S; Sathish, BN",,,Andaman Islands; Disturbance; Invasive species; Species density; Tropical forest; Understory plants,SPECIES RICHNESS; WESTERN-GHATS; GROUND HERBS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; TREES; GAPS,Pondicherry University,"[Rasingam, L.; Parthasarathy, N.] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India","Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.","Andaman and Nicobar Island Forest Plantation and Development Corporation Limited, Port Blair",,,,,,,,,,

We quantified available standing biomass, regeneration and population of highly preferred species and their consumption patterns. The study revealed a spatio-temporal variation in resource extraction. The standing biomass of preferred woody species at low altitude permanent villages and high altitude summer camping sites (Kharaks) were 140.68±26.91 and 477.46±31.8 t/ha, respectively. Average fuel wood consumption per household at permanent villages was 14.65±0.78 kg/day whereas consumption per temporary hut (Chhans) at camping sites was 36.42±3.35 kg/day. Higher per capita consumption of fuel wood in the camping sites due to seasonal migration of local as well as transhumants locally known as Gujjars had put immense pressure on sub-alpine forests. An increase in the demands for natural resources was noticed due to an augmented influx of tourists, which would further lead to the degradation of already scarce resources in the sub-alpine areas. Thus increased resource extraction from the low as well as high altitude forests simultaneously, may not be sustainable in the long run.

Area of study: The study was carried out in Dhanaulti forest which falls under temperate region of Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand state, India. Material and methods: Vegetation analysis was carried out using 10 quadrats at each altitude using a quadrat size of 10x10 m(2). In each quadrat, categories of trees > 30 cm cbh were considered as trees, 10-30 cm cbh as saplings and <10 cm cbh as seedlings. The data were quantitatively analyzed. Main results: In upper and middle altitudes, Cedrus deodara was reported dominant tree whereas, in lower altitude Quercus leucotrichophora was reported dominant. Tree density was highest in lower altitude which reduced middle and upper altitudes whereas, total basal cover increased with increasing altitude. The increasing total basal cover with altitude could be because of the presence of Cedrus deodara trees having higher girth classes. In tree, sapling and seedling layers, diversity (H) and equitabiltiy (EC) decreased with increasing altitude. However, concentrations of dominace (CD) and beta diversity (BD have shown reverse trend with H and EC which increased with increasing altitudes, in each layer of tree, sapling and seedling. The distribution pattern of most species in all layers of trees, saplings and seedlings was contagious. The regeneration potential of the species has shown that some of the species in the absence of tree layer are still regenerating particularly, Rhododendron arboreum, Benthamidia capitata, Neolitsea pallens etc. It indicates that most of the species are shifting upward as they are getting suitable conditions.

The relationships between diversity, biomass and C stocks at varied altitudes can have crucial implications for the management and conservation of C sinks. The study was undertaken in moist temperate Mandal-Chopta forest of Chamoli District, Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India with the following objectives: (1) to assess live tree biomass and C stocks along an altitudinal gradient; (2) to assess relationship of live tree C density (TCD) with altitude, species richness, diversity and density, and (3) to compare values of live tree biomass and C density of the present study with the earlier reported values in forests of other parts of Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand and India. The total live tree biomass density (TBD) varied from 215.5 to 468.2 Mg ha(-1) and TCD varied from 107.8 to 234.1 Mg C ha(-1). The average values of TBD and TCD for the study area were 356.8 +/- 83.0 Mg ha(-1) and 178.4 +/- 41.5 Mg C ha(-1) respectively. Comparative assessment of the data suggests that these values are similar to the earlier recorded values of C and biomass density for other forests of Garhwal Himalaya and Uttarakhand, but are higher than those reported from most of the other parts of the country. The stem density showed positive correlation with species richness (0.852) and diversity (0.749). No correlation between TCD and diversity was observed. However, statistically significant positive correlation of TCD with altitude (0.579) was observed, which could be attributed to dominance of large conifers and hardwoods at higher altitudes compared to lower altitudes.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2011,CURRENT SCIENCE,"Gairola, S; Sharma, CM; Ghildiyal, SK; Suyal, S",,,,FOREST IMPLICATIONS; PATTERNS; RELATEDNESS; SIMILARITY; SIGNAL; SCALE,Michigan State University,"Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Swenson, NG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",Michigan State University,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,,,,,,,

A study was carried out to understand the effect of management strategies on the biodiversity, soil nutrient, and carbon stock of two community forests practiced by Jamatia (JCF) and Halam (HCF) tribes of Tripura, northeast India. The forest managed by Jamatia is community conserved, whereas the Joint Forest Management (JFM) regulation issued by the Government of India was implemented in Halam community-based forest. JCF showed higher tree diversity (2.741) than HCF (2.176), while there was no significant variation in the total number of species in these forests. Anogeissus acuminata, Schima wallichii, and Terminalia bellirica were the most dominant species in JCF and HCF. A relatively higher amount of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content was found in JCF soils. JCF showed higher carbon stock (342.9 Mg C ha–1) than HCF (158.7 Mg C ha–1). A positive and significant correlation of SOC concentration was observed with soil moisture, SOM, and soil nutrient content. The results show that both stands were at developmental stages; however, regular extraction of biomass from HCF was attributable to lower carbon stock. We found that the Jamatia communities are proactively involved in the conservation of forests and sustainable management of biodiversity under their control.

Very fine (less than or equal to 1 mm) and fine (> 1 - less than or equal to -3 mm) root biomass and NPP were significantly altered in man-modified ecosystems such as forest plantations and agroecosystems. Very fine-root biomass and NPP were significantly (P < 0.01) greater in natural ecosystems (biomass 245 and 263 g/m(2); NPP 476 and 527 g/m(2)/year) when compared to monoculture plantations (172, 113, 125 g/m(2); 368, 293, 320 g/m(2)/year: respectively) and agroecosystems (88, 104, 97, 156 g/m(2); 227, 301, 295, 376 g/m(2)/year, respectively) except in teak plantations (230 g/m(2); 463 g/m(2)/year, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the case of fine-root biomass. This could be attributed to tree density and basal area along with greater litter accumulation. The lower biomass and NPP in man-modified ecosystems could be attributed to species composition, low organic matter, and soil fertility. Recurrence of annual fire could lead to reoccupation of the land by grass cover. This may be the reason for greater below-ground biomass and NPP in deciduous forests and teak plantations. The present study reveals that fine-root biomass and NPP are significantly altered by anthropogenic perturbation of natural forest ecosystems. Fine roots generally comprise only a small proportion of the total root biomass in an ecosystem, but fine roots are a more accurate indicator of root function than large roots (Berish, 1982). Fine roots located in surface soil layers also are important in nutrient cycling (Medina and Cuevas, 1989) and undergo rapid change in response to perturbations (Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1993).",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),1998,"ROOT DEMOGRAPHICS AND THEIR EFFICIENCIES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, GRASSLANDS AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS","Sundarapandian, S; Swamy, P",,,,,Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Forest Coll, Mettupalayam 641301, India","Parthiban, KT (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Forest Coll, Mettupalayam 641301, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

However, this information on temperate forests of the Himalayas is lacking and fragmented. In this study, we measured C stocks of tree (aboveground and below-ground biomass), understory (shrubs and herbaceous), deadwood (standing and fallen trees and stumps), floor litter, and soil from 111 plots of 50 m x 50 m each, in seven forest types: Populus deltoides (PD), Juglans regia (JR), Cedrus deodara (CD), Pinus wallichiana (PW), mixed coniferous (MC), Abies pindrow (AP), and Betula utilis (BU) in temperate forests of Kashmir Himalaya, India. The main objective of the present study is to quantify the ecosystem C pool in these seven forest types. The results showed that the tree biomass ranged from 100.8 Mg ha(-1) in BU forest to 294.8 Mg ha(-1) for the AP forest. The understory biomass ranged from 0.16 Mg ha(-1) in PD forest to 2.36 Mg ha(-1) in PW forest. Deadwood biomass ranged from 1.5 Mg ha(-1) in PD forest to 14.9 Mg ha(-1) for the AP forest, whereas forest floor litter ranged from 2.5 Mg ha(-1) in BU and JR forests to 3.1Mg ha(-1) in MC forest. The total ecosystem carbon stocks varied from 112.5 to 205.7 Mg C ha(-1) across all the forest types. The C stocks of tree, understory, deadwood, litter, and soil ranged from 45.4 to 135.6, 0.08 to 1.18, 0.7 to 6.8, 1.1 to 1.4, and 39.1-91.4 Mg ha(-1), respectively, which accounted for 61.3, 0.2, 1.4, 0.8, and 36.3% of the total carbon stock. BU forest accounted 65 % from soil C and 35 % from biomass, whereas PD forest contributed only 26 % from soil C and 74 % from biomass. Of the total C stock in the 0-30-cm soil, about 55 % was stored in the upper 0-10 cm. Soil C stocks in BU forest were significantly higher than those in other forests. The variability of C pools of different ecosystem components is influenced by vegetation type, stand structure, management history, and altitude. Our results reveal that a higher percentage (63 %) of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in these temperate forests except at the higher elevation broad-leaved BU forest. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional and global C cycles and have great implications for planning strategies for conservation.

Forested areas in the lower western Himalaya in India constitute the headwater catchments for many hill streams and have experienced degradation in forest cover due to grazing, deforestation and other human activities. This change in forest cover is likely to alter the soil moisture regime and, consequently, flow regimes in streams. The effect of change in forest cover on soil moisture regimes of this dry region has not been studied through long term field observations. We monitored soil matric potentials in two small watersheds in the lower western Himalaya of India. The watersheds consisted of homogeneous land covers of moderately dense oak forest and moderately degraded mixed oak forest. Observations were recorded at three sites at three depths in each watershed at fortnightly intervals for a period of three years. The soil moisture contents derived from soil potential measurements were analyzed to understand the spatial, temporal and profile variations under the two structures of forest cover. The analysis revealed large variations in soil moisture storage at different sites and depths and also during different seasons in each watershed. Mean soil moisture storage during monsoon, winter and summer seasons was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. Highest soil moisture content occurred at shallow soil profiles, decreasing with depth in both watersheds. A high positive correlation was found between tree density and soil moisture content. Mean soil moisture content over the entire study period was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. This indicated a potential for soil water storage under well man-aged oak forest.

The Pachamalai reserve forest is a part of Eastern Ghats in Tamil Nadu. The amount of biomass and carbon stock was estimated by allometric equation at different altitudes. The results revealed that height and diameter of trees are increasing from lower to higher altitudes.

,,,A2631,271,2632,Patterns of Carbon Sequestration in Forests of Western Ghats and Study of Applicability of Remote Sensing in Generating Carbon Credits through Afforestation/Reforestation,"Satellite remote sensing is a proven tool for mapping landuse patterns and estimating vegetation biomass/carbon. Present study aims at estimating the potential of forests of Radhanagari WLS (Western Ghats, India) to sequester the atmospheric carbon-di-oxide, using ground based observations coupled with satellite remote sensing. The study area was stratified for dominant forest types based on the structure and composition of vegetation and elevation variations. Permanent sample plots were laid down in these homogeneous vegetation strata (HVS) to make different observations during time 1 and time 2. Carbon sequestration by plantations was also studied and compared with natural forests. Species and area-specific biomass equations were used for estimating carbon pool and sequestration. Among natural forests 'mixed moist deciduous' forests exhibited highest sequestration rate (8%), whereas, plantation as obvious had a comparatively higher sequestration rate than natural forests (20.27%). Total carbon sequestration by forests of the Radhanagari WLS between 2004 and 2006 is 78742.09 tons. Eligible land for reforestation activity under clean development mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto Protocol was identified using satellite remote sensing using 1989 and 2005 datasets and it was observed that the potential land that can be used for reforestation activity is 10080 ha.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12524-009-0035-5,2009,JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING,"Kale, MP; Ravan, SA; Roy, PS; Singh, S",,,Rhizosphere; Microbial biomass; Soil enzymes; Respiration; Microbial index,ORGANIC-MATTER; DEHYDROGENASE-ACTIVITY; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; BIOMASS CARBON; QUALITY; NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; FOREST; L.,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Central Institute of Mining & Fuel Research (CIMFR),"[Sinha, Shipra; Masto, R.

Species diversity, dominance, species richness and evenness indices of plant communities and also population structure of woody plants were enumerated. A total of 244 species (183 genera and 76 families) were recorded. Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status. Terminalia paniculata (IVI of 99.9) and Hopea parviflora (IVI of 103.8) were dominant tree species respectively in LEF and MEF whereas in HEF Agrostistachys meeboldii (63.65), Cullenia excelsa (63.67) and Drypetes oblongifolia (39.67) share the dominance. Past damage (anthropogenic perturbation) may be one of the reasons for single species dominance in LEF and MEF. Occurrence of alien species such as Eupatorium odoratum and Ageratum conyzoides also indicated the past disturbance in LEF.

In this study, we selected the coniferous forests of Bhallesa Hills, situated in Pir Panjal Mountain (Jammu and Kashmir) of the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot as a study area and used the quadrat method to document the floristic diversity over four years (2018â€“2021). The study sites were divided into four sub-sites (Chilli, Kahal, Chanwari, Gandoh), and at each site, 25 replicated plots (each measuring 2500 m2, 50 Ã— 50 m2) were established for repeated surveys and documentation. We then analysed species diversity, lifeforms, phenology and leaf size spectra of coniferous plant communities. We consulted various pieces of literature to understand native and non-native plants. The results showed that the species diversity and species richness, growth forms and phenology varied in the experimental plots. In total, we found 328 plant species belonging to 228 genera and 78 families from different localities of various growth forms. Approximately 68.51% of the plant species were native, and 31.49%of the species were non-native. In angiosperms, dicotyledon species were found to be dominant, with 83.23% of the total plant species, while the family Asteraceae was common, with 38 species. The biological spectrum analysis showed 29% of the species were chamaephytes, followed by 28% as therophytes and 21% as phanerophytes. We observed that plant communities respond differently to the existing environment drivers, with chamaephyte and therophytes being more tightly linked to temperate mixed-coniferous and alpine ecosystems, affected by climates and the availability of substrates for their growth and existence. The leaf size spectra analyses showed nanophyll (42.81%) as the dominant group. Conservation-prioritised species (IUCN, regional most threatened species in India), such as Taxus wallichiana Zucc., Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth., Trillium govanianum Wall. ex D.Don, Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle and Euphorbia obovata Decne were found to be the most endangered plants. The results indicated more indigenous species, but there is a slow process of depletion of wild species, leading to colonisation by exotic alien species. This study indicated forests of the Himalayan regions are degrading at a faster rate, species are showing a shift in phenological behaviour due to anthropogenic factors leading to climate change, and indigenous species need conservation measures.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.3390/f13122050,2022,FORESTS,"Surmal, O; Singh, B; Musarella, CM",,,biomass; density; diversity; earthworms; mixed evergreen forest; pasture; silvopasture,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; LANDSCAPE; DENSITY; FOREST,Shoolini University; Adama Science & Technology University; Guru Nanak Dev University; Gifu University; Shoolini University; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Animal Reproduction & Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences; Addis Ababa University,"[Gudeta, Kasahun; Julka, Jatinder Mohan] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, India; [Gudeta, Kasahun; Bantihun, Getachew] Adama Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Adama 1888, Ethiopia; [Bhagat, Ankeet] Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Zool, Amritsar 143005, India; [Bhat, Sartaj Ahmad] Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Sharma, Gopal Krishan] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Agr Sci, Solan 173229, India; [Amarowicz, Ryszard] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Anim Reprod & Food Res, PL-10748 Olsztyn, Poland; [Belina, Merga] Addis Ababa Univ, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Dept Stat, Addis Ababa 1000, Ethiopia","Gudeta, K (corresponding author), Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, India.;Gudeta, K (corresponding author), Adama Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Adama 1888, Ethiopia.;Bhat, SA (corresponding author), Gifu Univ, River Basin Res Ctr, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 5011193, Japan.",,gold,,,,,,,,,

Diversity was higher in moderately disturbed dunes compared to less or severely disturbed dunes. Among the 38 macrofungi recovered, ten, six, two and one species were edible, ectomycorrhizal, medicinal and considered to be of decorative value, respectively. Ten macrofungi were dominant (>= 5 fruit bodies/625 m(2)) on the coastal sand dunes.

The coastal sand dunes are under severe anthropogenic pressure, especially urbanization, sand extraction, agricultural activities and seawall construction. The revegetated dunes are mainly represented by exotic tree species (e.g., Acacia and Casuarina), which are often harvested. Due to the removal of native vegetation and the 'grow and harvest' policy associated with exotic trees, the native flora, fauna and macrofungi of the coastal sand dunes are severely threatened. The results obtained in the present pilot study point out the need for long-term temporal and spatial investigation of the macrofungal resource of coastal sand dunes to gain a more comprehensive knowledge on their abundance, diversity, ecological significance, benefits and what must be done to implement strategies necessary for conservation.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.5943/mycosphere/5/1/6,2014,MYCOSPHERE,"Ghate, SD; Sridhar, KR; Karun, NC",,,Ascomycetes; Basidiomycetes; Himachal Pradesh; Uttarakhand,AMANITA,Mekelle University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University,"[Semwal, K.

Canopy cover-type mapping has been done in most of the bioclimatic zones of India and widely abroad, using aerial photointepretation techniques. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop a methodology for mapping understorey vegetation in part of Kanha National Park, using 1:10,000-scale black-and-white aerial photographs. The Park, one of the best for Tiger (Felis tigris) visibility and observation of other large carnivores and herbivores, has been mapped, with subdivision into 11 vegetation cover-classes and four density-classes, using aerial photographs, and each class has been visited in the field for understorey information concerning different physiographic units. Each category of canopy-cover was sampled in the field, and tree base-cover per hectare has been estimated. Vertical profiles have also been drawn in the main vegetation classes in order to understand the occurrence of understorey vegetation. It was found that a physiographic analysis coupled with canopy-cover type and density, with appropriate sampling in the individual vegetation strata, have together proved indicative of understorey vegetation-type. When the relationship between understorey vegetation and canopy-cover type is established, one can directly depict understorey limits spatially in conjunction with the main vegetation cover. Such an approach of mapping understorey vegetation using aerial photographs could be of immense value for wildlife habitat evaluation and park management.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900021299,1991,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"PORWAL, MC; ROY, PS",,,,,,,"NAIR, KSS (corresponding author), KERALA FOREST RES INST,DIV ENTOMOL,PEECHI 680653,KERALA,INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2513,282,2514,Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter,"Human-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.

,,,A1712,283,1713,Revisiting forest types of India,"Champion and Seth undertook the pioneering work on classification of forests in India. Earlier Sir H. G. Champion had compiled his monumental work 'Preliminary Survey of Forest Types of India and Burma' in 1936. The original work of 1936 was revised by Sir H. G. Champion with S.K. Seth which was published as 'A Revised Survey of the Forest Types of India'. Their work helped the forest managers and researchers all over the Indian sub-continent to prepare management plans for the scientific management of forests. India's forest types are very diverse in their compositions with a long evolutionary and geological history, occurring under many climatic and edaphic conditions. They have been undergoing subtle but significant changes in the composition of forests since the forest types were revised by Champion and Seth. These changes have taken place on account of climatic changes and anthropogenic causes (biotic pressure as well as management interventions). The present study was conducted by revisiting various forest types. It was aimed at assessing the changes that have occurred over a period of time since they were revised by Champion and Seth. The field survey covered more than 200 forest types and subtypes representing very diverse climatic and edaphic conditions across the country. The sample plots were generated randomly across different forest types. Data collected from the field surveys were analyzed for preparing the change matrix of forest types, basal area, importance value index, stem density and diversity indexes including similarity indexes. Impact of climate change on the vegetation was critically examined to see the species level responses to the changes in the rainfall and temperature regimes over the past years. The study has indicated many changes occurring at species and forest subtypes levels. The species level changes were observed largely in Shorea robusta (Sal), Tectona grandis (Teak) and Bamboo forests with regard to their distribution and species density. The study has indicated the absence of teak from very moist and moist teak sub-type and occurrence of many moist deciduous and semi-evergreen species. In central India, the low rainfall regime has shown the decline of Sal and occurrence of dry deciduous species. The study revealed that both positive and negative changes have been witnessed in various forest types. These findings could be used by the policy makers, scientists and foresters for evolving suitable strategies for futuristic management intervention so that the objectives of sustainable forest management are realised. The new classification of forest types has been proposed reflecting the present ecological, climatic, bio-geographic and edaphic influences on the vegetation composition and stand formation. In the proposed new classification, 10 major groups and 48 sub-groups were identified.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1505/146554816818966345,2016,INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW,"Bahuguna, VK; Swaminath, MH; Tripathi, S; Singh, TP; Rawat, VRS; Rawat, RS",,,Casuarina; Expressed sequence tag; Microsatellite markers; Genetic diversity and population structure,SEQUENCE REPEAT MARKERS; EST-SSR MARKERS; RAPD VARIATION; IN-SILICO; INFERENCE; SOFTWARE; PLANTS; ISSR; SPP.,,"[Kullan, A.

Comparatively, at TLR site, 40% of the tree species showed fair regeneration, 40% good, and the remaining 20% showed no regeneration. Across the two sites, species richness and diversity significantly decreased as the altitudinal gradient increased. Vegetation structure and soil properties also revealed differences between the southern and northern aspects. The baseline information generated in this study is helpful in designing effective conservation and management measures for these ecologically sensitive and important ecosystems. To effectively monitor changes in vegetation structure, species composition, and regeneration, we suggest that permanent vegetation plots with meteorological stations be established across the region for long-term monitoring of forest dynamics in response to the changing climate and anthropogenic pressures.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275051,2022,PLOS ONE,"Maletha, A; Maikhuri, RK; Bargali, SS; Sharma, A; Negi, VS; Rawat, LS",,,Electric vehicles; CO2 emissions; Characteristics of diffusion; Attitude; Purchase intention,BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES; CONSUMER ATTITUDES; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE; WIDESPREAD ADOPTION; PURCHASE INTENTION; DECOMPOSED THEORY; GREEN; ATTRIBUTES; BARRIERS,Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya,"[Arora, Subhash Chander; Sharma, Megha; Singh, Vinod Kumar] Gurukula Kangri Deemed Univ, Fac Management Studies, Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India","Arora, SC (corresponding author), Gurukula Kangri Deemed Univ, Fac Management Studies, Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India.",,"Green Published, Bronze",,,,,,,,,
,,,A1517,288,1518,Climate change effects in the Western Himalayan ecosystems of India: evidence and strategies,"Background: The fragile landscapes of the Himalayan region are highly susceptible to natural hazards, and there is ongoing concern about current and potential climate change impacts. This study provides background information on India's Western Himalayas and reviews evidence of warming as well as variability in precipitation and extreme events. Methods: Understanding and anticipating the impacts of climate change on Himalayan forest ecosystems and the services they provide to people are critical. Efforts to develop and implement effective policies and management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation requires particular new research initiatives. The various studies initiated and conducted in the region are compiled here. Results: Several new initiatives taken by the Himalayan Forest Research Institute in Shimla are described. This includes new permanent observational field studies, some with mapped trees, in high altitude transitional zones for continuous monitoring of vegetation response. We have also presented new strategies for mitigating potential climate change effects in Himalayan forest ecosystems. Conclusions: Assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of the Himalayan conifers is required to evaluate potential responses to changing climatic conditions. Conservation strategies for the important temperate medicinal plants need to be developed. The impact of climate change on insects and pathogens in the Himalayas also need to be assessed. Coordinated efforts are necessary to develop effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40663-017-0100-4,2017,FOREST ECOSYSTEMS,"Tewari, VP; Verma, RK; von Gadow, K",,,Plants; Polyphenols; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Inflammation,IN-VITRO; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; SUBGINGIVAL PLAQUE; LEAF EXTRACT; POLYPHENOLS; GINGIVALIS; SECRETION; CRANBERRY; COAGGREGATION; INHIBITION,Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center,"[Heyman, Leali; Houri-Haddad, Yael; Gleitman, Yossi; Feuerstein, Osnat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Hadassah Hosp & Med Sch, Fac Med Dent, Dept Prosthodont, POB 12272, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel; [Heyman, Samuel N.] Hadassah Hebrew Univ Hosp, Dept Med, Jerusalem, Israel; [Ginsburg, Isaac] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Hadassah Hosp & Med Sch, Fac Med Dent, Inst Dent Res, Jerusalem, Israel","Feuerstein, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Hadassah Hosp & Med Sch, Fac Med Dent, Dept Prosthodont, POB 12272, IL-91120 Jerusalem, Israel.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

A total of 33 fungal species were isolated from leaf segments. Of 33 taxa, 20 were recorded as endophytes, while 22 as epiphytes. Nine, out of 33 species were found to be common in leaf tissues and surfaces (Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Drechslera rostrata, Humicola grisea, Nigrospora oryzae, Penicillium cristata, and Pestalotia sp.). Out of 478 fungal isolates, 279 were epiphytic while only 199 were endophytic. Most isolates were anamorphic filamentous fungi which often don't produce sexual spores. The Sorensen's index of similarity between endophytes and epiphytes (leaf surface colonizers) was found to be at 0.300. Diversity index of fungal species was higher in endophytes than epiphytes. The frequency of colonization differs greatly in both myco-populations. Cladosporium cladosporioides (26%) was dominant species on leaf surfaces while Botrytis cinerea (10.5%) was dominant in leaf tissues.

The objectives of this study were to assess the improvement in mine soil quality and C sequestration potential of the post mining reclaimed land with time. Hence, this study was conducted in reclaimed chronosequence sites (young, intermediate and old) of a large open cast coal project (Central Coal Fields Limited, Jharkhand, India) and results were compared to a reference forest site (Sal forest, Shorea robusta). Mine soil quality was assessed in terms of accretion of soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N) and soil CO2 flux along with the age of revegetation. After 14 years of revegetation, SOC and N concentrations increased three and five-fold, respectively and found equivalent to the reference site. Accretion of SOC stock was estimated to be 1.9 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Total ecosystem C sequestered after 2-14 years of revegetation increased from 8 Mg C ha(-1) to 90 Mg C ha(-1) (30-333 Mg CO2 ha(-1)) with an average rate of 6.4 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Above ground biomass contributes maximum C sequestrate (50%) in revegetated site. CO2 flux increased with age of revegetation and found 11, 33 and 42 Mg CO2 ha(-1)year(-1) in younger, intermediate and older dumps, respectively. Soil respiration in revegetated site is more influenced by the temperature than soil moisture. Results of the study also showed that trees like, Dalbergia sissoo and Heterophragma adenophyllum should be preferred for revegetation of mine degraded sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,A0141,296,142,Trunk picking from a truncating menu: Dry season forage selection by Asian elephant in a multi-use landscape,"Elephants show a strong selection towards areas with high foraging opportunities at the landscape level making top-down decisions by first selecting patch types within landscapes and finally species within them. Understanding forage selection in a multi-use landscape is critical for prioritising patches for habitat management, ensuring availability of selected forage, helping in minimizing pressure on food crops and subsequent negative interactions with people. We assessed dry season forage selection in a multi-use landscape of West Bengal state, India. Relative forage use and relative plant species availability ratio were calculated to assess forage selection in a multi-use landscape comprising of the forest, tea estates, agricultural land, and human settlement. Forage use was assessed using the opportunistic feeding trail observation method (150.01 km). Stratified random sampling was used to assess plant species availability using the quadrat method (123 plots of 0.1 ha each). Among 286 plant species recorded, 132 plant species were consumed by elephants. A majority (80.21%) of plant species were consumed more than the proportional availability thereby showing selective foraging during the dry season in the study area. From forest to semi-open forest and open forest, canopy layer tree density and the total number of species decreased whereas invasive species density increased. This indicates the high impact on the forage species availability for elephants and the requirement of appropriate habitat management strategies. The presence of 32.14% of the selected forage species in human-use landscape alone demands the development of conservation interventions. This is the first study to assess forage selection by elephants in a multi-use landscape and used to prioritise conservation and management strategies at a landscape level.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271052,2022,PLOS ONE,"Das, P; Kshettry, A; Kumara, HN",,,Blue carbon; Mangrove; Seagrass; Salt marsh; Aboveground biomass; Belowground biomass; Soil carbon pool,ORGANIC-CARBON; PALK BAY; SEAGRASS ECOSYSTEMS; MANGROVE FORESTS; GROUND BIOMASS; EAST-COAST; SEDIMENTS; MATTER; STOCKS; SOIL,Port & Airport Research Institute; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Jadavpur University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"[Akhand, Anirban] Port & Airport Res Inst, Coastal & Estuarine Environm Res Grp, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Akhand, Anirban] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chanda, Abhra] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Jameel, Yusuf] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Integrated Sustainabil Ctr ISC, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan","Chanda, A (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) [CRRP2018-03MY-Hashimoto],,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1348,297,1349,Phylogenetic diversity patterns in Himalayan forests reveal evidence for environmental filtering of distinct lineages,"Large-scale environmental gradients have been invaluable for unraveling the processes shaping the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Environmental gradients provide a natural setting to test theories about species diversity and distributions within a landscape with changing biotic and abiotic interactions. Elevational gradients are particularly useful because they often encompass a large climatic range within a small geographical extent. Here, we analyzed tree communities in plots located throughout Arunachal Pradesh, a province in northeast India located on the southern face of the Eastern Himalayas, representing one of the largest elevational gradients in the world. Using indices of species and phylogenetic diversity, we described shifts in community structure across the landscape and explored the putative biotic and abiotic forces influencing species assembly. As expected, species richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased with increasing elevation; however, contrary to predictions of environmental filtering, species relatedness did not show any clear trend. Nonetheless, patterns of beta diversity (both taxonomic and phylogenetic) strongly suggest lineage filtering along the elevational gradient. Our results may be explained if filtering is driving the assembly of species from distinct evolutionary lineages. New metrics exploring community contributions to regional taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity provided additional evidence for the persistence of unique communities at high elevations. We suggest that these patterns may be consistent with filtering on glacial relicts, part of once more diverse clades with convergent traits suited to climates at the last glacial maximum, resulting in random or over-dispersed community assemblages at high elevations. We propose that these high-elevation sites with evolutionarily distinct species represent possible regions for conservation priority that may provide refugia for species threatened by current warming trends.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2157,2018,ECOSPHERE,"Shooner, S; Davies, TJ; Saikia, P; Deka, J; Bharali, S; Tripathi, OP; Singha, L; Khan, ML; Dayanandan, S",,,BBCH scale; footstalk; jackfruit; phenology,CHEMISCHE-INDUSTRIE SCALE; BIOLOGISCHE-BUNDESANTALT; BUNDESSORTENAMT; CODIFICATION,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Horticultural Research,"[Kishore, Kundan] ICAR IIHR, Cent Hort Expt Stn, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","Kishore, K (corresponding author), ICAR IIHR, Cent Hort Expt Stn, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2220,301,2221,"A landscape-level assessment of Asian elephant habitat, its population and elephant-human conflict in the Anamalai hill ranges of southern Western Ghats, India","Spatial information at the landscape scale is extremely important for conservation planning, especially in the case of long-ranging vertebrates. The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant-human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600 km(2). Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000 km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275 km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% Cl = 0.99-1.2) elephant/km(2). Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being subadults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant-human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant-human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant-human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.

The remote sensing data revealed that in the submergence zone only mixed deciduous forest that occupies 807.5ha area and has a wood biomass volume of 4,027,503m3 is likely to be lost due to impoundment. A total of 165 plant species found in the submergence zone also occur in the influence and free draining catchment area of the project. In the influence zone of the project area only one tree species (Acer oblongum) is found under conservation threat category, which is also present in the free draining catchment of the project. The project affected population (6716 people) residing in the submergence and influence zone depend upon the surrounding forests for fuel wood, fodder, wild edibles etc., and most likely they will settle in the nearby areas, thus mounting more pressure on residual forests of the influence zone for various forest products. Further, from the vegetation analysis it is evident that several tree species (e.g. Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata, T. bellerica etc.), may face more pressure from exploitation as they provide a number of useful products and are represented in lower numbers in the forests of the project area. To compensate for the loss of various goods and services provided by the forests falling in the submergence zone and to offset the increased pressure of the project affected families on the forests of influence zone, a biodiversity management plan is suggested incorporating socio-economic considerations.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2010.490060,2010,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,"Panwar, S; Agrawal, DK; Negi, GCS; Kanwal, KS; Sharma, V; Lodhi, MS; Singh, J; Bhatt, V",,,micro-watershed; land use; terracing; economics; soil chemical properties; hydrology; farmer perception,,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Grassland & Fodder Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - ICAR Research Complex for NEH Region,"[Singh, Kumar Amarendra] Indian Grassland & Fodder Res Inst, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Akshayaber; Satapathy, Krishna Kishore; Yadav, Bindeshwari Prasad Singh; Chandra, Ram] ICAR Res Complex NEH Reg, Umiam, Meghalaya, India","Singh, KA (corresponding author), Indian Grassland & Fodder Res Inst, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1917,304,1918,And yet it shrinks: A novel method for correcting bias in forest tree growth estimates caused by water-induced fluctuations,"Accuracy in tree woody growth estimates is important to global carbon budget estimation and climate-change science. Tree growth in permanent sampling plots (PSPs) is commonly estimated by measuring stem diameter changes, but this method is susceptible to bias resulting from water-induced reversible stem shrinkage. In the absence of bias correction, temporal variability in growth is likely to be overestimated and incorrectly attributed to fluctuations in resource availability, especially in forests with high seasonal and inter-annual variability in water. We propose and test a novel approach for estimating and correcting this bias at the community level. In a 50-ha PSP from a seasonally dry tropical forest in southern India, where tape measurements have been taken every four years from 1988 to 2012, for nine trees we estimated bias due to reversible stem shrinkage as the difference between woody growth measured using tree rings and that estimated from tape. We tested if the bias estimated from these trees could be used as a proxy to correct bias in tape-based growth estimates at the PSP scale. We observed significant shrinkage-related bias in the growth estimates of the nine trees in some censuses. This bias was strongly linearly related to tape-based growth estimates at the level of the PSP, and could be used as a proxy. After bias was corrected, the temporal variance in growth rates of the PSP decreased, while the effect of exceptionally dry or wet periods was retained, indicating that at least a part of the temporal variability arose from reversible shrinkage-related bias. We also suggest that the efficacy of the bias correction could be improved by measuring the proxy on trees that belong to different size classes and census timing, but not necessarily to different species. Our approach allows for reanalysis - and possible reinterpretation of temporal trends in tree growth, above ground biomass change, or carbon fluxes in forests, and their relationships with resource availability in the context of climate change.

The average gap size in the study area was found to be 396 m(2) and around half of gaps were 4-8 years old. Gaps created by natural single tree fall were smaller in size but significantly higher in number. Diversity and regeneration of woody species were compared with canopy gaps and intact vegetation. Species richness and diversity was higher in gaps than in intact vegetation. Macaranga peltata, a shade intolerant species dominated gaps while intact vegetation was dominated by shade tolerant Kingiodendron pinnatum. Gap size significantly influenced species diversity and regeneration. Gap area and age were significantly and negatively correlated with diversity measures but positively correlated with regeneration.

Species diversity and stem density were compared between plantations and secondary dry deciduous forests separately for adults and seedlings of trees, shrubs and lianas (collectively termed woody species). No significant difference was found between the two vegetation types in the seedling and adult species diversity. The adult stem density was significantly higher in plantations compared to the secondary forests, but the opposite was found to be true for basal area perindividual. Species abundance in plantations deviated from log normal distribution while the secondary forests showed log-normal species abundance distribution. The size-class distribution of adults in plantations had greater positive skewness than the secondary forests due to high relative abundance of species in smaller size-classes. Overall results show that plantations have similar species richness as secondary forests, but have disproportionate abundance of sprouting and asexually reproducing species.

Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in regulating carbon cycling, thus having a significant impact on global environmental change. Extensive studies have been conducted for the estimation of mangrove species identification and biomass estimation. However, estimation at a regional level with species-wise biomass distribution has been insufficiently investigated in the past because either research focuses on the species distribution or biomass assessment. Study shows that good relationship has been achieved between stem volume (field measured data) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from satellite image and further these two indices are employed to estimate thebiomass in the study site. Three models- linear, logarithmic and polynomial (second degree) are used to estimate biomass derived from EVI and NDVI. The hyperspectral data (spatial resolution similar to 30m) is utilised to identify ten mangrove plant species. We have prepared the spatial distribution map of these species using spectral angle mapper. We have also generated mangrove species-wise biomass distribution map of the study site along with areal coverage of each species.The results indicate that the Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. and Cynometra iripa Kostel has the highest biomass among all ten identified species, 643.12Mgha(-1) and 652.14Mgha(-1). Our study provided a positive relationship between NDVI, EVI, and the estimated biomass of Bhitarkanika Forest Reserve Odisha India. The study finds a similar results for both NDVI and EVI derived biomass, while linear regression has more significant results than thepolynomial (second degree) and logarithmic regression derived biomass. Thepolynomial is foundslightly better than thelogarithmic when using theEVI as compared to NDVI derived biomass. The spatial distribution of species-wise biomass mapobtained in this study using both, EVI and NDVI could be used to provide useful information for biodiversity assessment along with thesustainable solutions to different problems associated with the mangrove forest biodiversity. Thus, biomass assessment of larger regions can be achieved by utilization of remote sensing based indices as concluded in the present study.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01698-8,2019,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Pandey, PC; Anand, A; Srivastava, PK",,,GLM; Landscape metrics; PFTs; Predictive modelling; Remote sensing,SPECIES RICHNESS; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; GRADIENTS; FOREST; SPACE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DETERMINANTS; EXPLANATION; PERFORMANCE,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Wildlife Institute of India","[Padalia, Hitendra; Bushra, Aimon; Nandy, Subrata] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Gajendra] Uttarakhand Space Applicat Ctr, Forestry & Climate Change Div, 93-2 Vasant Vihar, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rai, Ishwari Datt; Rawat, Gopal S.] Wildlife Inst India, PB 18, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttar Pradesh, India","Padalia, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Biomass-based carbon estimation was undertaken in two subtropical broadleaved forest stands viz., Mawnai (MBF) and Nongkrem (NBF) and adjacent Pinus kesiya dominated forest stands (MPF and NPF), occurring in similar topography, climatic conditions and soil type. The aboveground and belowground tree biomass was estimated using existing allometric models. Carbon was estimated as 47.4% of the total biomass.

This study, therefore, aims to assess the above- and belowground carbon storage potential of a semi-arid forest ecosystem of Delhi.MethodsFor the study, two forest sites were selected, i.e., north ridge (NRF)and central ridge(CRF). Aboveground tree biomass was estimated by using growing stock volume equations developed by Forest Survey of India and specific wood density. Understory biomass was determined by harvest sampling method. Belowground (root) biomass was determined by using a developed equation. For soil organic carbon (SOC), soil samples were collected at 0-10-cm and 10-20-cm depth and carbon content was estimated.ResultsThe present study estimated 90.51Mgha(-1) biomass and 63.49MgCha(-1) carbon in the semi-arid forest of Delhi, India. The lower diameter classes showed highest tree density, i.e., 240 and 328 individuals ha(-1) (11-20cm), basal area, i.e., 8.7 (31-40cm) and 6.08m(2)ha(-1) (11-20cm), and biomass, i.e., 24.25 and 23.57Mgha(-1) (11-20cm) in NRF and CRF, respectively. Furthermore, a significant contribution of biomass (7.8Mgha(-1)) in DBH class 81-90cm in NRF suggested the importance of mature trees in biomass and carbon storage. The forests were predominantly occupied by Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC which also showed the highest contribution to the (approximately 40%) tree biomass. Carbon allocation was maximum in aboveground (40-49%), followed by soil (29.93-37.7%), belowground or root (20-22%), and litter (0.27-0.59%).ConclusionOur study suggested plant biomass and soils are the potential pools of carbon storage in these forests. Furthermore, carbon storage in tree biomass was found to be mainly influenced by tree density, basal area, and species diversity. Trees belonging to lower DBH classes are the major carbon sinks in these forests. In the study, native trees contributed to the significant amount of carbon stored in their biomass and soils.

The study presents a regression based woody biomass estimation for tropical deciduous mixed forest dominated by Shores robusta using ALOS PALSAR mosaic (HH, HV) and field data at the lower Himalayan belt of Northern India. For the purpose of understanding the scattering mechanisms at L-band from this forest type, Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS-I) was parameterized with field data to simulate bacicscatter across polarization and incidence range. Regression analysis between field measured forest biomass and L-band bacicscatter data from PALSAR mosaic show retrieval of woody biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1) with error between 92 and 94 Mg ha(-1) and coefficient of determination (r(2)) between 0.53 and 0.55 for HH and HH + HV polarized channel at 0.25 ha resolution. This positive relationship could be due to strong volume scattering from ground/trunk interaction at HH-polarized while in combination with direct canopy scattering for HV-polarization at ALOS specific incidence angles as predicted by MIMICS-I model. This study has found that L-band SAR data from currently ALOS-1/-2 and upcoming joint NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) are suitable for mapping forest biomass <= 100 Mg ha(-1) at 25 m resolution in far incidence range in dense deciduous mixed forest of Northern India.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.03.007,2018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,"Ningthoujam, RK; Joshi, PK; Roy, PS",,,Functional traits; Phylogenetic turnover; Deciduous; Evergreen; Niche-based processes; Human disturbance,BETA-DIVERSITY; COASTAL CALIFORNIA; CLIMATIC GRADIENTS; AMAZONIAN FOREST; REGIONAL-SCALE; PLANT TRAITS; WOOD DENSITY; PATTERNS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,Concordia University - Canada; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore,"[Shivaprakash, K.

Birds were observed in 19 100-m-long transects, 3 times per season per transect, for 2 seasons from 1997 to 1998 and 1998 to 1999, in an area where forests are subject to various degrees of pressure from human disturbances. Closed canopy forests with relatively undisturbed habitat showed significant variation in habitat attributes, suggesting complexity of habitat structure. Bird species richness and diversity were significantly related to moderately disturbed habitats represented by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where vegetation heterogeneity (vertical stratification and species composition) was greater. Analysis by migratory groups did not show an interpretable relationship with the habitats, except for the seasonal movements of migratory groups when correlated with altitudinal gradient along the corridor However, feeding guilds showed significant relationships when correlated with different habitat types. Guilds such as insectivores showed a significant positive relationship with relatively undisturbed habitat, whereas nectarivores and granivores were associated with disturbed habitat. Such relationships have the potential to help assess bird communities and their habitat preferences.

The present study aims to provide the contribution of the Cedrus deodara forests under the current stresses for climate mitigation by analysing the three elevation ranges of the Dhanaulti forest division of Garhwal Himalaya, India. The results report that soil organic carbon (SOC) was adversely and bulk density favourably related with elevation. Moreover, SOC as CO2eq also decreased significantly with an increase in soil depths. Biomass carbon for various parts of the plant was also estimated for the three elevations of the Cedrus deodara forests. The trend in total carbon stock (bole, branch, twig, foliage and soil) decreased significantly with an increase in altitude. The carbon stock of Cedrus deodara forests was maximum (545 t ha−1) at upper altitude (2350 m.a.s.l) and minimum (330 t ha−1) at a lower altitude (2050 m.a.s.l). The difference in litter production between the seasons is significant with maximum production in summer followed by rainy and winter seasons. This study provides inputs for greenhouse gas (GHG) estimation for national communication to various platforms. The information on the soil is crucial for understanding about the ecology of the forests assisting prediction of functioning and productivity of forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-021-09941-w,2021,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,"Sheikh, MA; Kumar, M; Todaria, NP; Bhat, JA; Kumar, A; Pandey, R",,,Land use changes; Soil microbes; Soil enzymes; Semiarid ecosystems; Land management practices,BIOMASS CARBON; ORGANIC-MATTER; EXTRACTION METHOD; FOREST ECOSYSTEM; RESTORED LANDS; NITROGEN; INDICATORS; COMMUNITY; QUALITY; RICE,University of Rajasthan; University of Delhi,"[Meena, Archana] Univ Rajasthan, Dept Bot, Jaipur 302004, Rajasthan, India; [Rao, K.

The forests of Eastern Ghats of India are also relatively under studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a large-scale, landscape-level investigation of liana diversity in six hill complexes of the South Eastern Ghats, which covers 4297 km2. We divided the study area into 6.25 km x 6.25 km grids and within each grid a 0.5 ha (5 m x 1000 m) transect was established and all lianas epsilon 1.5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were inventoried in 110 transects totalling a 55-ha area. Liana diversity totalled 143 species in 83 genera and 37 families in the 55 ha sampled. Of these 20 species (28.6%) were endemic to peninsular India and 7 (10%) species belonged to the rare and endangered category. Liana species richness ranged from 8-35 species and density 95-544 individuals per transect. A total of 32 033 liana individuals were enumerated in the 55 ha and the mean abundance was 291 individuals per transect. Across sites, liana abundance varied significantly, but not species richness and basal area. Asclepiadaceae (13 species, 9%) and Apocynaceae (11 species, 8%) constituted the most diverse liana families, followed by Papilionaceae, Vitaceae (10 each, 7%), Convolvulaceae, Mimosaceae, Oleaceae (8 each, 6%), Capparaceae, Rhamnaceae (7 each, 5%) and Menispermaceae (5 species, 3%). In liana stem size distribution, the lowest diameter class (1.5-3 cm dbh) accounted for greatest species richness (137 species, 96%), abundance (27358 individuals, 85%) and basal area (13.5 m2, 36%). The stem twiners were the predominant climber type in terms of species richness (61 species, 42.65%), whereas the armed scramblers were abundant due to stem density (21571 individuals, 67.34%). The dispersal modes of lianas, assessed by fruit types, revealed zoochory as the prevalent mode (85 species, 59%) indicating the faunal dependence of lianas in the Eastern Ghats landscape. Liana diversity of the Eastern Ghats was compared with inventories made across the tropics. With these baseline data generated on lianas, the importance of biodiversity conservation of the already fragmented South Eastern Ghats region is underlined and potential areas of further research on liana ecology are suggested.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/14772001003723546,2010,SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY,"Muthumperumal, C; Parthasarathy, N",,,,PROTECTIVE ROLE; EAST-COAST; MANGROVE; SCENARIO; IMPACT,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Institute of Oceanography (NIO),"Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India","Mascarenhas, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

These transects were assigned to 7 vegetation types and were shown to be distinctive in species composition. These types include closed canopy evergreen, semi-closed canopy evergreen, stunted evergreen, semievergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and scrub/savanna vegetation. Dry deciduous forests with low levels of density and diversity harbour a rather exclusive set of species. The most diverse tree assemblages belong to the semievergreen forest type, which harbours widespread species extensively shared with other vegetation types. The semiclosed evergreen forests resemble semievergreen forests in many ways. In contrast, the stunted evergreen forests and scrub/savanna exhibit low values of tree density and diversity; their component species have very weak tendencies to co-occur with each other. The evergreen and moist deciduous forests exhibit moderate to high density and diversity and moderate levels of distinctiveness of species composition. The evergreen forests however resemble dry deciduous forests in harbouring species with a strong tendency to co-occur and many species with restricted distributions. More moist vegetation types shelter a higher proportion of evergreen and endemic trees and a lower proportion of medicinally-useful species.

The present study aims to assess the biomass and soil carbon (C) stock in the hydroelectric catchment in India and further, its implications to mitigate GHG emissions. The estimation depicts the low ‘C’ stock in the reservoir’s catchment in comparison to reservoirs located globally in the same eco-region which will ultimately result in lower GHG emission in the future. Moreover, estimated total carbon density of the forest species was found as 54.92 ± 18.07 MgC.ha−1 while mean SOC was 79.64 ± 19.32 MgC.ha−1. The average total ‘C’ stock of Tehri hydroelectric reservoir’s catchment was estimated as 134.56 MgC.ha−1. Moreover, ratios (total flooded carbon/installed capacity) comprised between 4 and304 kgC/W from the other reservoirs reported globally. These ratios are higher than the Tehri reservoir (0.28 kgC/W) as flooded area of Tehri reservoir during impoundment was 52 km2. Thus, Tehri reservoir was found to emit less GHG in time to come.

Chloroxylon swietenia emerged as the most dominant tree species having highest importance value index, followed by Tectona grandis, Terminalia tomentosa, and Hardwickia binata. Nine tree species and their saplings, including Sterculia urens and Terminalia arjuna, were exploited so badly that they were only found in the seedlings stage. The unavailability of standing trees of 12 important tree species including Aegle marmelos and Phyllanthus emblica indicates the intensity and gravity of anthropogenic pressures on these important tree species.

Few studies have reported the ecosystem services offered by lianas. This chapter presents the research conducted in eighteen tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF) sites on the Coromandel Coast of India to investigate various ecosystem services rendered by the liana life-form. Lianas in the studied sites contributed a total of 56 species to forest plant biodiversity and added 15,224 individuals to forest stand. At individual sites, liana species richness ranged from 11 species ha(-1) to 31 species ha(-1) and the density contribution ranged from 408 individuals ha(-1) to 1,658 individuals ha(-1). The proportion of lianas to total woody species (lianas + trees) richness ranged from 0.38 to 0.53 and the proportion of stem density varied from 0.29 to 0.62. To the total forest aboveground biomass, lianas contributed 411.26 Mg. Further, lianas in our sites provide valuable resources to various faunal groups chiefl y the forest foliar herbivores, florivores and frugivores. Among the leaf-eaters, beetles and lepidopteran larvae formed the major foliar herbivores. Bees and butterflies are the major fl oral resource users, while birds consumed major fruit resources of TDEF ecosystem.

,,,A1604,324,1605,Sapling harvest: A predominant factor affecting future composition of tropical dry forests,"Degradation of tropical forests is of global concern and studies of the ecosystem processes concerned with the regeneration of trees have a great value for reforestation management. We analysed the structure of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in India in terms of the composition of small-diameter trees (saplings) at five distinct sites located along a gradient of soil moisture, and investigated the effects of biotic and abiotic disturbances on the diversity, aboveground biomass (AGB), AGB-accumulation, annual recruitment index (ARI) and annual mortality index (AMI) of saplings. Aim of the study was to analyse the relative impact of important disturbing factors on the species composition of saplings in the TDF. Study questions were: (1) how is the TDF structured in terms of tree saplings and their AGB? (2) what are the levels of biotic and abiotic disturbances which affect sapling population, forest regeneration and future composition of the community? (3) what is the relationship between species mortality and recruitment in the sites having different disturbance intensities? and (4) what is the relative importance of individual disturbing factors for the recruitment, mortality and structure of sapling community? Stepwise multiple regressions were performed for predicting species richness, stem density, mean AGB, AGB-accumulation, ARI and AMI from mean values of soil moisture content (SMC), harvest index, browse index, drought index and fire index. Results showed 80, 15, 4.5 and 0.5%, mortality through harvest, browse, drought, and fire, respectively. Floristic composition of the sapling population was different compared to that of the mature trees. Selective harvesting of the saplings of large canopy trees such as Terminalia tomentosa and Shorea robusta indicated the possiblity of change in floristic composition of the TDF in future. Tree saplings in our TDF are mainly damaged by illegal harvesting. Compared to browsing and natural mortality on account of drought and fire, damage to saplings due to harvesting was substantially higher at most of the study sites. In this study, the site which had the lowest level of SMC throughout the year, contained the lowest number of species and sapling stems and also had the greatest level of disturbance in terms of damaged saplings. In order to protect and improve the diversity and recruitment of tree saplings, we suggest to restrict the illegal (unauthorized) harvesting and to control browsing in the forest. Particularly the saplings of the dominant canopy trees and those with high biomass accumulation potential need to be protected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We derived dissimilarity matrices between all pairs of the 36 sampling sites with respect to forest structure, floristics, and bird species composition and ran Mantel's randomization tests to detect significant associations among the matrices after partialling out the effect of geographic distance between sites. Bird species composition was found to be significantly related to forest structure across habitats, and floristics within the moist-deciduous forests. This finding is consistent with earlier observations that birds respond, in their species composition, to vegetation structure across habitats and to vegetation composition within a habitat. As predicted, the composition of insectivorous birds was influenced by forest structure, but the phytophagous guild did not show any relation to vegetation composition in contrast to patterns observed elsewhere. We explain this anomaly as a result of availability of a wide choice of food plants for phytophagous birds in central Indian tropical forests and weak species-environment relationships on account of their nomadism. Extraction of non-timber forest products remains a key economic activity in central India and our results imply that it can potentially influence the composition of forest bird communities through alteration of forest structure and floristics.

,,,A2147,327,2148,Crown allometries are less responsive than stem allometry to tree size and habitat variations in an Indian monsoon forest,"While theoretical allometric models postulate universal scaling exponents, empirical relationships between tree dimensions show marked variability that reflects changes in the biomass allocation pattern. As growth of the various tree compartments may be controlled by different functions, it is hypothesized that they may respond differently to factors of variation, resulting in variable tree morphologies and potentially in trade-offs between allometric relationships. We explore the variability of tree stem and crown allometries using a dataset of 1,729 trees located in an undisturbed wet evergreen forest of the Western Ghats, India. We specifically test whether species adult stature, terrain slope, tree size and crown light exposure affect the relationships between stem diameter and stem height (stem allometry), and between stem diameter and crown width, crown area and crown volume (crown allometries). Results show that both stem and crown allometries are subject to variations in relation to both endogenous (tree size, species adult stature) and exogenous (terrain slope, crown light exposure) factors. Stem allometry appears to be more affected by these factors than are crown allometries, including the stem diameter-crown volume relationship, which proved to be particularly stable. Our results support the idea that height is a prevailing adjustment factor for a tree facing variable growth (notably light) conditions, while stem diameter-crown volume allometry responds more to internal metabolic constraints. We ultimately discuss the various sources of variability in the stem and crown allometries of tropical trees that likely play an important role in forest community dynamics.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00468-013-0896-7,2013,TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,"Antin, C; Pelissier, R; Vincent, G; Couteron, P",,,climate change; ecosystem change; global vegetation,ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR JULES; MODEL DESCRIPTION; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; CARBON-CYCLE; VEGETATION; FEEDBACKS; CO2; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS,Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Cambridge; University of Sheffield; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); Met Office - UK; Hadley Centre; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Max Planck Society; The Santa Fe Institute,"[Warszawski, Lila; Ostberg, Sebastian; Frieler, Katja; Lucht, Wolfgang; Schaphoff, Sibyll; Buechner, Matthias; Piontek, Franziska; Schewe, Jacob; Serdeczny, Olivia; Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Friend, Andrew; Rademacher, Tim Tito] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Beerling, David; Lomas, Mark] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Cadule, Patricia; Ciais, Philippe] Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Clark, Douglas B.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Kahana, Ron] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Ito, Akihiko; Nishina, Kazuya] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Global Environm Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kleidon, Axel; Pavlick, Ryan] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, D-07701 Jena, Germany; [Schellnhuber, Hans Joachim] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Warszawski, L (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [01LS1201A]; Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety [11_II_093_Global_A_SIDS and LDCs]; Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Programme [GA01101]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan; European Union [266992]; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh010022] Funding Source: researchfish","Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,,,,,,,

Therefore, in the present study, the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage pattern was assessed from 70 plots laid at three selected forest types comprising seven study sites at Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Ghats, India: tropical dry deciduous (TDD I and TDD II), tropical semi-evergreen (TSE I and TSE II) and tropical evergreen forest (TEF I, TEF II and TEF III) at three depths (0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm). Statistical analyses were performed to understand the relationships between SOC stocks with other predictor variables. The SOC stock varied markedly with forest type and site-wise. The SOC ranged from 58 (TEF III) to 123.6 (TDD I) Mg C/ha with a mean of 84.9 +/- 4.4 Mg C/ha at 0-30 cm depth. SOC stock decreased, while soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth.

Of the total SOC stock (0-30 cm), 44.2, 32.0 and 23.8% were stored in 0-10, 10.1-20 and 20.1-30 cm respectively in all the forest types. In contrast, litter C stock were high in TEF and TSE forest types and low in TDD forest type. SOC showed significant (P < 0.01) negative relationships with bulk density, litter C, and vegetation attributes. The SOC stock stored in the study sites amount to 212.9 (TEF III) to 453.6 (TDD I) Mg of CO2 equivalents. The present study reveals that forest type and site characteristics have a profound impact on SOC stock, which would, in turn, exert a great bearing on the ecosystem C cycling. These results would also enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forest types in soil C sequestration and for developing and validating SOC models for tropical forest ecosystems.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7881-6,2019,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Subashree, K; Dar, JA; Sundarapandian, S",,,biological spectrum; Kashmir Himalaya; phenological; protected forest; riparian,ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA; PHENOLOGY; VALLEY; PLANTS; CONSERVATION; PATTERNS; SPECTRA; HABITAT,University of Kashmir; University of Malakand,"[Haq, Shiek Marifatul] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India; [Malik, Zubair A.] GHSS, Dept Bot, Anantnag 192201, J&K, India; [Rahman, Inayat Ur] Univ Malakand, Dept Bot, Lab Plant Ecol, Chakdara 28800, Pakistan","Rahman, IU (corresponding author), Univ Malakand, Dept Bot, Lab Plant Ecol, Chakdara 28800, Pakistan.",,,,,,,,,,,

Cost-effective and accurate estimation of LAI is essential for under-assessed carbon-rich tropical forests, e.g., mangroves. Here, we developed allometric equations to estimate LAI using a combination of non-destructive, optical measurements through digital hemispherical photographs (DHP), and genetic programming-based Symbolic Regression (SR). We used three structural variables: diameter at breast height (DBH), tree density (TD), and canopy height (Ht) for a mangrove forest in the BhitarKanika Wildlife Sanctuary (BWS), located along the Eastern coast of India. Triplet combination using SR provided the best equation (R2 = 0.51) than any singlet or duplet combination of the variables, and even it was better than Partial Least Square (PLS) based regression (R2 = 0.42). To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the maiden attempt to develop an allometric model to estimate LAI for a mangrove ecosystem in India. In-situ measurements of structural variables such as DBH, Ht, and TD can be used for LAI estimates, as shown here.

It is considered as a potential indicator of phytoclimatic conditions of the ecosystem in which it populates. The spatial distribution patterns of life-forms vary from one ecosystem to another due to variation in the environmental gradients. The present study was aimed to assess the distribution patterns of different life-forms along the altitudinal gradients in the Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP) situated in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh (Western Himalaya, India). We prepared a checklist of flowering plants of the park (945 taxa, 470 genera, 188 families) using both primary (field surveys) and secondary data (earlier published literature) sources. The entire altitudinal range was classified into seven altitude classes. The presence/absence (1/0) species data matrix was prepared using local altitudinal distribution range of each species to investigate the similarity in species composition and patterns of life-forms across the seven altitudinal classes. The Cluster analysis classified the seven altitudinal classes into four distinct plant communities at different altitudes. Maximum similarity (43.77%) in species composition was recorded between 3000-3500 m and 3500-4000 m altitude classes. In terms of number of species, Asteraceae (101 taxa) and Potentilla (11 taxa) revealed as dominant family and genus respectively. The species richness peaks at middle altitude (1500-3000 m) in the GHNP. The phytoclimate of GHNP can be termed as 'phanero-therophytic' (ï¼œ1500 m), 'thero-phanerophytic' (1500-3000 m) 'thero-hemicryptophytic' (3000-4000 m) and 'crypto-hemicryptophytic' (ï¼ž4000 m) at different altitudes.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.6165/tai.2020.65.154,2020,TAIWANIA,"Das, DS; Rawat, DS; Maity, D; Dash, SS; Sinha, BK",,,public health; tropical medicine; microbiology; parasitology; epidemiology; immunology,RISK-FACTORS; ELEPHANTIASIS; PREVALENCE; BIAS,University of Gondar; University of Gondar,"[Alemnew, Birhan] Woldia Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Woldia, Ethiopia; [Fasil, Alebachew] Univ Gondar, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Chem, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Mulatu, Tesfahun] Woldia Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Woldia, Ethiopia; [Bililign, Nigus] Woldia Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Midwifery, Woldia, Ethiopia; [Esthetie, Setegn] Univ Gondar, Coll Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Med Microbiol, Gondar, Ethiopia; [Demis, Asmamaw] Woldia Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing, Woldia, Ethiopia","Alemnew, B (corresponding author), Woldia Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Med Lab Sci, Woldia, Ethiopia.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

A stratified random approach was used for selecting the four homegardens (HGs) with a size of 1hectare (ha). The study mainly focused on species richness, diversity, above ground biomass, carbon, correlation and distribution of carbon with various variables, species and group wise carbon storage of the system. A total of 992 trees from 66 species belonging to 31 families were enumerated with representation of 4 endemic, 1 vulnerable, 1 endangered and 23 exotics. The diversity indices obtained were closer to those of the forest ecosystem. Above ground biomass and carbon density were estimated to be 67.06 t/ha (tonne/hectare) and 31.85 6 t/ha respectively. Species Tectona grandis showed dominancy in carbon and Important Value Index. Correlation analysis among species revealed that carbon exhibited a strong positive trend with basal area and tree density, but in the case of plot (HG)-wise examination only basal area had a strong positive relationship. The diametric class analysis showed skewed type of distribution for carbon and tree density while diversity had reverse j-shaped curve. Among the two plant groups, cultivated species had an edge over native in storing carbon. Overall, this assessment shows the potential of using homegardens as a socio-ecological systems for sustainable development particularly in terms of land availability and climate mitigation options in the face of rapid urbanization.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42965-021-00149-2,2021,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Padmakumar, B; Sreekanth, NP; Shanthiprabha, V; Paul, J; Sreedharan, K; Augustine, T; Jayasooryan, KK; Rameshan, M; Arunbabu, V; Mohan, M; Sylas, VP; Ramasamy, EV; Thomas, AP",,,guava; DNA extraction methods; DNA integrity; DNA quantification; lyophilization; sequencing,GENETIC DIVERSITY; EXTRACTION; RAPD,Universidad Costa Rica; Universidad Costa Rica,"[Sanchez-Barrantes, Elodia; Barrantes-Santamaria, Walter] Univ Costa Rica, Lab Biol Mol, Estn Expt Fabio Baudrit Moreno, Alajuela, Costa Rica; [Mora-Newcomer, Eric] Univ Costa Rica, Programa Mejoramiento Genet Guayaba, Estn Expt Fabio Baudrit Moreno, Alajuela, Costa Rica","Barrantes-Santamaria, W (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Lab Biol Mol, Estn Expt Fabio Baudrit Moreno, Alajuela, Costa Rica.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

Here, we unfold the dispersal profile of India and provide comprehensive information on plant–disperser relationships, emphasising on plant longevities (annual, biennial, and perennial), plant life forms (tree, shrub, herb, liana), and vegetation types. The floral data were collected from a national database, and the dispersal information of 3301 geo-tagged plant species was gathered. The plant dispersal types were mainly (1) abiotic (hydrochory—water, anemochory—wind) and (2) biotic (endozoochory—internal gut, epizoochory—adherence to external surface, anthropochory—human, ornithochory—bird, myrmecochory—insect, and chirepterochory—bat) that included five dispersal modes, i.e. monochory (single), dichory (double), trichory (triple), quadrichory (four), and quintuchory (five). The generalised linear model was utilised to evaluate plant–disperser relationships. Monochory could explain variances of 56.8%, 51.2%, and 45.1% in perennials, annuals, and biennials, and 45.3%, 46.3%, 39.4%, and 47.7% for trees, shrubs, herbs, and lianas, respectively. Monochory has more significant influence on all major vegetation types, with at least 40% variance explanation. Anemochory, the dispersal by wind factor, was found to exercise by most plants. The life form wise analytics revealed inclination of multiple modes of dispersal for herbs with abiotic factors might be due to lighter weight, followed by trees with biotic dispersers could be owing to large size seeds. The same trend was reported from herb-dominant grassland where abiotic factors mostly contribute to dispersal, whereas the tree-dominant vegetation types exhibit dispersal primarily due to biotic means. This study provides a synoptic diagnosis to understand the dispersal profile of India, which has been an understudied domain.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7703-x,2019,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Behera, MD; Roy, PS; Mahanand, S; Panda, RM; Padhee, S",,,Bonnet macaque; Forest-dwelling; Habitat fragmentation; Lion-tailed macaque; Management; Urban; Western Ghats,WESTERN-GHATS; ANAMALAI HILLS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; CONSERVATION STATUS; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; ANAIMALAI HILLS; RAIN-FORESTS; HABITAT; DEMOGRAPHY; PRIMATES,University of Mysore,"[Singh, Mewa] Univ Mysore, Institut Excellence, Biopsychol Lab, Mysuru, India","Singh, M (corresponding author), Univ Mysore, Institut Excellence, Biopsychol Lab, Mysuru, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However. bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition.

We measured landscape composition and configuration around each site with a geographic information system. To identify factors associated with diversity we constructed multivariate models by using a decision-tree technique. The conventional measures of landscape such as patch size did not influence species richness. Distance of sacred groves front The forest reserve bad a weak influence. The measures of landscape structure (e.g., tree cover in the surroundings) and stand structure (e.g., variability in canopy height) contributed to The variation in species richness explained by multivariate models.

Ninety plots were sampled for saplings (1-5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh); 5x5-m plots) and overstorey trees (>9.55 cm dbh; 20x20-m plots) within two fragments (32 ha and 18 ha) and two continuous forests. We tested the hypotheses that fragmentation and expected seed-dispersal declines (1) reduce sapling densities and species richness of all species and old-growth species, and increase recruitment of early-successional species, (2) reduce the prevalence of dispersed recruits and (3) increase influence of local overstorey on sapling densities and richness. Continuous forests and fragments had similar sapling densities and species richness overall, but density and richness of old-growth species declined by 62% and 48%, respectively, in fragments. Fragments had 39% lower densities and 24% lower richness of immigrant saplings (presumed dispersed into sites as conspecific adults were absent nearby), and immigrant densities of old-growth bird-dispersed species declined by 79%. Sapling species richness (overall and old-growth) increased with overstorey species richness in fragments, but was unrelated to overstorey richness in continuous forests. Our results show that while forest fragments retain significant sapling diversity, losses of immigrant recruits and increased overstorey influence strengthen barriers to natural regeneration of old-growth tropical rain forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467417000219,2017,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Osuri, AM; Chakravarthy, D; Mudappa, D; Raman, TRS; Ayyappan, N; Muthuramkumar, S; Parthasarathy, N",,,Birds; Habitat use; Sikkim; Sub-canopy; Vertical stratification,LOWLAND RAIN-FOREST; TROPICAL DRY FOREST; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; WESTERN-GHATS; HABITAT VARIABLES; COSTA-RICA; COMMUNITIES; CANOPY; RICHNESS; BATS,Salim Ali Center for Ornithology & Natural History (SACON); Sikkim University,"[Acharya, Bhoj Kumar; Vijayan, Lalitha] Salim Ali Ctr Ornithol & Nat Hist SACON, Div Conservat Ecol, Coimbatore 641108, Tamil Nadu, India; [Acharya, Bhoj Kumar] Sikkim Univ, Dept Zool, Tadong 737102, Gangtok, India; [Vijayan, Lalitha] Salim Ali Fdn, Trichur 680027, Kerala, India","Acharya, BK (corresponding author), Salim Ali Ctr Ornithol & Nat Hist SACON, Div Conservat Ecol, Coimbatore 641108, Tamil Nadu, India.;Acharya, BK (corresponding author), Sikkim Univ, Dept Zool, Tadong 737102, Gangtok, India.","Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India",,,,,,,,,,

,,,A1495,344,1496,"Vegetation ecology and carbon sequestration potential of shrubs in tropics of Chhattisgarh, India","Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide. Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha(-1) and 2.79 to 4.92 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson's index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76 t ha(-1), respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59-3.53 t ha(-1) year(-1) while the C sequestration potential of 0.71-1.57 t ha(-1) year(-1) under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6246-2,2017,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Jhariya, MK",,,Gross primary productivity (GPP); leaf area index (LAI); aggregated canopy model (ACM); Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); tropical forest; MetFlux India,LEAF-AREA INDEX; DECIDUOUS BROADLEAF FOREST; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; PRIMARY PRODUCTION GPP; SOIL CO2 FLUX; EDDY-COVARIANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MODIS-GPP; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; NATIONAL FOREST,Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Centre for Climate Change Research - India; Tezpur University; University of Edinburgh; Savitribai Phule Pune University,"[Burman, Pramit Kumar Deb; Chakraborty, Supriyo] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Sarma, Dipankar] Tezpur Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Tezpur 784028, India; [Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Karipot, Anandakumar] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Atmospher & Space Sci, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Burman, PKD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.","Earth System Science Organization (ESSO) of Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India","Green Accepted, Bronze",,,,,,,,,

The management practice varies and there are forests with high degree of protection, where no extraction (sacred forests) is allowed. There are also forests with moderate- level of protection and -extraction (reserved forests) as well as forests with low level of protection and open extraction (village forests). The present study was conducted to understand the impact of this traditional management system on the level of human disturbance, and on community composition and structure of the forests in Khasi hills of Meghalaya. The result revealed that disturbance index was low, whereas species richness, density and basal cover were significantly high in forests with high degree of protection (sacred forest) than those with low protection (reserved and village forest). Majority of endemic and threatened plant species were restricted to sacred forests as compared to the other forest types. Though these practices have ensured the sustainable use of forest resources by the local people but due to increased human- pressure and -disturbances, more effective conservation strategies need to be undertaken.

Species inventory was taken in 25 m(2) plots, established at 10 m intervals along edge to interior transects. The measured soil variables included pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil moisture, Microenvironmental factors including light transmittance, relative humidity, and air and soil temperatures also were monitored. Both edaphic and microenvironmental factors exhibited strong patterns along the edge to interior gradient, Forest edges were characterized by higher light transmittance, higher air and soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity. Soil variables including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and moisture increased toward the forest interior. Significant increases in organic carbon (53.9%), total nitrogen (47%), and soil moisture (55%) indicated a relatively fertile forest interior compared with the forest edge. A definite floristic compositional pattern also was observed along the edge to interior gradient which was correlated to the edaphic and microenvironmental variables as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. It appears that edge effects in these high altitude forests penetrate to a distance of 15-30 m. Further, edaphic factors have an important influence on woody species regeneration, perhaps much more than microenvironmental factors, This indicates that any disturbance that significantly exposes the forest floor, thus lowering soil moisture and altering soil nutrient status, can adversely affect the regeneration of many of the shola species.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03836-4,1996,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Jose, S; Gillespie, AR; George, SJ; Kumar, BM",,,Bambusa arudinacea; biomass productivity; nutrient cycling; teak plantation,FOREST,,,"Chandrashekara, UM (corresponding author), KERALA FOREST RES INST, PEECHI 680653, KERALA, INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,

Ten sampling quadrates 20x20, 5x5 and 1x1m were randomly laid for overstorey (OS), understorey (US) and ground vegetation (GS), respectively. Girth of trees was measured at breast height and collar diameters of shrubs and herbs at 0.1m height. Biomass was estimated using allometric regression equations and herb biomass by harvesting. Net primary productivity (NPP) was determined by summing biomass increment and litter crop values. Aspect and slope influenced the vegetation types, biomass and NPP in different forests. Standing biomass and NPP varied from 18.6 to 101.5Mgha(-1) and 5.3 to 12.7Mgha(-1) a(-1), respectively, in different forest types. The highest biomass was found in dense mixed forest, while net production recoded in Teak forests. Both were lowest in degraded mixed forests of different forest types.

,,,A0377,360,378,Global distribution of soapberries (Sapindus L.) habitats under current and future climate scenarios,"Abstract Sapindus ( Sapindus L.) is a widely distributed economically important tree genus that provides biodiesel, biomedical and biochemical products. However, with climate change, deforestation, and economic development, the diversity of Sapindus germplasms may face the risk of destruction. Therefore, utilising historical environmental data and future climate projections from the BCC-CSM2-MR global climate database, we simulated the current and future global distributions of suitable habitats for Sapindus using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model. The estimated ecological thresholds for critical environmental factors were: a minimum temperature of 0â€“20Â Â°C in the coldest month, soil moisture levels of 40â€“140Â mm, a mean temperature of 2â€“25Â Â°C in the driest quarter, a mean temperature of 19â€“28Â Â°C in the wettest quarter, and a soil pH of 5.6â€“7.6. The total suitable habitat area was 6059.97â€‰Ã—â€‰10 4 km 2 , which was unevenly distributed across six continents. As greenhouse gas emissions increased over time, the area of suitable habitats contracted in lower latitudes and expanded in higher latitudes. Consequently, surveys and conservation should be prioritised in southern hemisphere areas which are in danger of becoming unsuitable. In contrast, other areas in northern and central America, China, and India can be used for conservation and large-scale cultivation in the future.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98389-8,2021,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Liu, JM; Wang, LC; Sun, CW; Xi, BY; Li, DD; Chen, Z; He, QY; Weng, XH; Jia, LM",,,built environment; epidemiology; green space; myopia; natural environment; NDVI; refractive error; urban environment,REFRACTIVE ERRORS; RESIDENTIAL GREENNESS; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; TIME SPENT; SCHOOLCHILDREN; PROGRESSION; POPULATION; IMI; ONSET; METAANALYSIS,University of New South Wales Sydney; Brien Holden Vision Institute; Childrens University Hospital - Temple Street; University of Canberra,"[Peng, Brian An; Jong, Monica] Univ New South Wales, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Naduvilath, Thomas John; Jong, Monica] Brien Holden Vis Inst, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Flitcroft, Daniel Ian] Childrens Univ Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Dublin, Ireland; [Jong, Monica] Univ Canberra, Discipline Optometry & Vis Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Jong, M (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Optometry & Vis Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",International Myopia Institute,,,,,,,,,,

The area surveyed included habitat disturbed by human activity, with both the grazing of livestock and firewood collecting resulting in degraded forest. Langur population density was estimated to be between 19 and 36 animals/km2 . The density of langurs in disturbed areas was significantly lower than in undisturbed areas. Both tree cover, total tree, and shrub cover were positively correlated with langur density, suggesting that a lack of trees in disturbed areas may have caused the lower langur densities. Although bisexual groups were significantly more common in undisturbed areas the distribution of all male groups did not appear to be affected by human disturbance, suggesting that male bands are likely to inhabit more disturbed habitats than bisexual groups. We suggest that either a lack of food trees or the high density of predators in Sariska may prevent bisexual groups from inhabiting areas where tree cover is low, although the more mobile male groups can survive in these areas. Although Hanuman langurs are a relatively common species in India, these results suggest that they are not, as is commonly assumed, immune to the effects of human disturbance. In areas where langurs appear to survive in disturbed habitats the different response of bisexual and all male groups to disturbance may still result in serious disruption to the population structure.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02382732,1994,PRIMATES,"ROSS, C; SRIVASTAVA, A",,No additional innformation on paper regardig the vegetation data,SIKKIM; MAMLAY WATERSHED; AGROFORESTRY; WEEKLY MARKET HAT; SYSTEM DYNAMICS; NUTRIENTS; MERITS; CONSTRAINTS,,,,"SUNDRIYAL, RC (corresponding author), GB PLANT INST HIMALAYAN ENVIRONM & DEV,SIKKIM UNIT,SIKKIM 737102,INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A3255,362,3256,Structure and floristic composition of a tropical evergreen forest in south-west India,"A permanent plot of 28 ha was established in a dense wet evergreen forest in the Western Chats of India to study the functioning of the ecosystem. Since April 1990, 1981 trees of greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh have been enumerated in a systematic sampling of five strips totalling 3.12 ha. This paper describes the main structural and floristic characteristics of the plot. The density (635 trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh per hectare) and basal area (39.7 m(2) ha(-1)) are high. Despite the high diversity (Simpson's D = 0.92 and Shannon's H' = 4.56), four species are distinctly dominant in terms of an importance value index (relative density + relative basal area). Each of these four species occupies a different layer in the ecosystem: Humboldtia brunonis Wall. (Fabaceae) dominates the undergrowth, Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (Myristicaceae) the intermediate strata, Vateria indica L. (Dipterocarpaceae) the higher canopy level and Dipterocarpus indicus Bedd. (Dipterocarpaceae) the emergents. This pronounced species hierarchy is one of the most important characteristics of the evergreen forests of the Western Chats. The two dipterocarps account for 20.1% of the total number of trees and contribute 40.9% to the total basal area. This formation can, therefore, be considered as the westernmost lowland dipterocarp forest of Asia. Analysis of the spatial variations in the floristic composition and in the structure of the main species populations shows that two kinds of mature phases can be identified: where the topography is raised and gently sloping, the vertical structure of the stand is discontinuous, with Dipterocarpus indicus and Vateria indica forming an emergent layer above a dense undergrowth; on slopes, the stand is lower, vertically continuous and saturated with Vateria indica and Myristica dactyloides.

Eleven true mangrove species and three mangrove associates formed the plant biomass where Avicennia officinalis was abundant in Site 1, Excoecaria agallocha in Site 2 and Avicennia officinalis, Rhizophora mucronata were abundant in Site 3. Total tree density varied from 11760 stems ha(-1) in Vypin Island (Site 2); 11440 stems ha(-1) in Mangalavanam Bird sanctuary (Site 3) and 7680 stems ha(-1), Aroor (Site1). The average stands basal area of the three mangrove habitats were 75.54, 54.85 and 103.26m(2) ha(-1). The mean annual litterfall production in Cochin mangroves was 16.57 +/- 6.58 t ha(-1) y(-1) in which leaves (53.90%) contributed more followed by flowers, propagules (28.66%) and twigs (17.44%). The spatial variability in litterfall recorded highest in lower latitudinal mangrove habitat, Site. 1 followed by Site 2 and Site 3 (2413.36 +/- 873.72, 1295.65 +/- 401.09, 1263.28 +/- 255.28 g DW m(-2)y(-1)). Site differences in litter production were statistically significant (one-way ANOVA p < 0.001 for total litterfall and p < 0.05 for litter components) between the three mangrove habitats. Litter components and total litterfall showed significant seasonality (p < 0.001). Highest litterfall was recorded in pre-monsoon period followed by post-monsoon and least in monsoon period. The temporal trend of litterfall was explained through rainfall and mean atmospheric temperature and a negative correlation was there to rainfall during the period. The mean carbon content in the litterfall was estimated as 42.96% of the dry weight and the primary productivity through litterfall in the study area was estimated to be 7.12 +/- 2.81 t C ha(-1) y(-1). This will act as the major source of carbon input to the mangrove ecosystem and surrounding coastal ecosystems and in turn reflected in NPP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Data were collected on the time spent feeding by one group on various plant species, and also on the vegetation, phenology and regeneration in plots subjected to shifting cultivation. Data for eight months indicated that Phayre's leaf monkey fed primarily on young leaves and to a lesser extent on shoots and seeds. Young leaves formed a consistently high proportion of the diet in all months. Most of the 18 food plant species were exploited for young leaves, but only a few for other plant parts. Six species accounted for more than 65% of the diet in all eight months, and more than 75% over all months. Regeneration and accumulation of woody biomass in areas subjected to shifting cultivation were rapid as a result of germination and coppicing. Five of the six most used plant species dominated this regeneration. It is concluded that Phayre's leaf monkey will survive in secondary forests provided regeneration is allowed to continue for at least 9-10 years. The progressively shortening cycle for shifting cultivation, however, poses a threat, and the small patches of primary forest which remain are also disappearing due to shifting cultivation or degradation.

Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied far their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367 ha(-1)) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower 'RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh greater than or equal to 10.1 cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SM are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups.

The present study was aimed to assess the above ground and below ground carbon stock and its relation with tree diversity parameters in two tropical moist deciduous forest sites, namely: Xylia dominated forest (XDF) and Sal dominated forest (SDF) of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), Odisha, India. A total of seventy-two tree species ≥ 5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were recorded, belonging to 62 genera and 27 families. Estimated average above-ground biomass carbon and soil organic carbon were 180.05 Mg C ha−1, 55.4 Mg C ha−1 and 209.3 Mg C ha−1, 61.8 Mg C ha−1 in XDF and SDF of SBR, respectively. Shorea robusta Gaertn. was the most carbon accumulating species of both the forests contributing about 21.5% of biomass carbon in XDF and 47.8% biomass carbon in SDF. Maximum carbon allocation was in above-ground biomass pool (69.04%) followed by soil organic carbon (20.9%) and below-ground biomass/root (10.1%). The correlation study revealed that above-ground biomass had strong positive correlation with basal area and Importance Value Index of tree species indicating importance of dominant species in carbon storage. Therefore, the dominant tree species such as S. robusta Gaertn., Xylia xylocarpa (Roxb.) Taub., Terminalia tomentosa Wight & Arn., Schleichera oleosa Lour.)

Investigations were carried out at a site covering the major dominant forest species grown in India. Cartosat-1 stereo data were analysed in conjunction with differential global positioning system (DGPS) measurements to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) and an orthoimage, which were used to estimate the biophysical variables. Analysis using grey-level co-occurrence texture measures was performed for separation of forest species, homogeneity of the classes of forest stands, stratification and measurement of crown area, canopy gap and stand density. Field measurements of tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), stand density, age and crown diameter were conducted for each stand. Empirical models for the estimation of DBH were developed and validated with Cartosat-1-derived height and crown diameter. Measured and estimated values were found to be in close proximity to each other. A local contrast co-occurrence measure (contrast, mean and variance) was suitable for the estimation of average crown diameter, stand density and canopy gap area for each forest stand class. The texture image provided information on structural attributes (i.e. stand density, crown diameter and canopy gap of the forest tree stands).

Pairwise tests indicated that L. camara was significantly associated with changes in plant species assemblage and grass cover within the moist and dry deciduous forest, but not in the thorn forest. The relationship between L. camara and that of elephant browse plants varied with species. A linear regression analysis indicated that L. camara invasion was the only significant predictor of grass occupancy. Our results indicate that in addition to other factors, L. camara was associated with altering plant species assemblage, some elephant browse plants and grass cover in the moist and dry deciduous forest.

Of the total carbon storage soil contributed 84.6 per cent of the total (50.1 Mg ha(-1)) followed by carbon in above ground vegetation 15 per cent (9 Mg ha(-1)) and carbon in litter floor mass 0.4 per cent (0.2 Mg ha(-1)). Practical implications - Bamboo plantation development and its management in home gardens has social, ecological and economical benefits for the rural life in North East India and its promotion can become an effective choice for climate change mitigation strategy. Originality/value - Bamboo forms an important component in the traditional home garden system of North East India where the practice of bamboo cultivation and management provides an important sink for CO2. Village bamboos play an important role in local economics, societies and environments and, considering its potential to mitigate global climate change, the authors recommend the promotion of bamboo in agroforestry expanding practices and rehabilitation of degraded lands. Management of village bamboos in rural landscape is highlighted in context to environmental sustainability and as a sink measure under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto Protocol.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1108/17568691211223169,2012,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,"Nath, AJ; Das, AK",,,,VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; NORTHERN INDIA; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; BLACK CARBON; CCN CHAMBER; AEROSOL; SPECTRA; CITY; ACTIVATION,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"[Patidar, V.; Tripathi, S.

In the ten independent sites, a 100 m x 100 m permanent plot was established, and all trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. Tree diversity totalled 77 species in 61 genera of 30 families. Tree density varied from 596 to 2813 stems ha(-1), and basal area ranged between 12.4 and 36.5 m(2) ha(-1). Species richness did not show any significant variation within and between the inland and coastal areas. We examined the relationship between basal area and site disturbance scores between the five sites of inland and coastal forest areas and found a negative correlation in both the areas. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the ten sites revealed the extent of species heterogeneity. The number of species and stems decreased from the smallest to largest girth class. The tree inventories of the studied sites when compared with those of other tropical dry evergreen forests showed great differences in density and basal area, probably due to different geographical location and varying annual rainfall patterns.

,,,A3207,373,3208,Investigating canopy regeneration processes through individual-based spatial models: application to a tropical rain forest,"Observations of circular structures in a permanent plot in a natural dense tropical forest of the Western Ghats (India) led to formulation of new hypotheses on the spatial organization resulting from interactions between trees. Here we propose a canopy regeneration process that does not involve treefall gaps. The peculiar spatial circular structure is composed of a central dominant tree with less than two trees under its crown and five or more other trees forming a ring at the limit of its crown. Such a structure is supposed to occur under certain conditions and, in particular, under strong competition for light. We describe a regeneration mechanism based on replacement of the central tree by a shift to one of the trees in its peripheral ring so that progressive recovery of the canopy occurs without large gap dynamics. We built a spatial simulator of forest dynamics in order to investigate the occurrence of such spatial structures and to examine their role in canopy regeneration. The model is an individual-based spatial model for mixed uneven-aged forest stands and accounts for annual evolution of the trees in the simulated stand, incorporating mortality, recruitment, growth and competition processes. The main originality of this model lies in the description of crown growth in eight cardinal directions, and in the use of neighbor position and size to express competitive interactions. The model demonstrates the development of the circular spatial structures in simulated stands as those observed in the permanent plot and shows that the proposed canopy regeneration mechanism can occur in the absence of perturbation.

Tree provides both tangible (timber, fuelwood, etc. For humans) and intangible benefits (as climate security through C sink) that maintains ecosystem processes. Tropical Sal forests are gaining popularity due to its remarkable contribution as C sink, storage, budget and flux. In the present study, an effort has been made to explore vegetational statistics along with C storage, budget and flux in four different site qualities (SQ) of Sal dominating tropical deciduous forest of Chhattisgarh, India. The density (individuals/ha) and basal area (m2/ha) varied from 710 to 1010 and 33.5–46.8 in tree, 2000–2500 and 0.32–0.33 in sapling and 9750–14500 and 17.96–21.43 in seedling, respectively in varying SQ. The total biomass varied from 182.27 to 375.84 t/ha in varying SQ. The total C in trees varied from 79.86 to 163.63 t ha−1. Quantity of C in above ground and below ground portions in trees on different sites were 72.32–143.36 t/ha and 7.54–20.27 t/ha, respectively. Total aboveground tree C sequestration values ranged between 5.12 and 11.68 t C ha−1yr−1 on different SQ. The C storage and net fluxes were represented in compartment models to assess the various SQ. As per models, forest received 14.63, 10.81, 8.19 and 6.83 t/ha/yr of C input through net primary production (NPP) in SQ-I, SQ-II, SQ-III and SQ-IV, respectively which are depleted as 3.55, 3.12, 2.77 and 2.33 t/ha/yr as total C input in the soil. Moreover 1.77 (SQ-I), 1.60 (SQ-II), 1.46 (SQ-III) and 1.30 (SQ-IV) t ha−1 yr−1of C were transferred from foliage to litter compartment, respectively.

Overall, 1964 lianas representing 30 species belonging to 24 genera and 18 families were recorded in this study. Liana species richness declined in both the sites since initial inventory. The TDEF sites revealed an overall increase in stem density for the families Loganiaceae, Papilionaceae, Tiliaceae, Combretaceae, and Celastraceae. The site PP subjected to extreme anthropogenic disturbances reported considerable decrease in its stem density. The diameter class 1–3 cm also revealed substantial decline in its stem density. The endemic species Derris ovalifolia showed an increase in its stem density in 19 years. Anthropogenic disturbances resulted in significant decrease in abundance of species such as Gymnema sylvestre and Jasminum angustifolium, which are known for their medicinal value. The present results provide insights on how anthropogenic disturbances alter species diversity, abundance, and resource values of lianas in TDEFs over a period of time, which will certainly be beneficial for proposing management strategies in the conservation of this forest type.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.6165/tai.2022.67.129,2022,TAIWANIA,"Nath, S; Babu, KN; Dilshad, K; Dar, AA; Parthasarathy, N",,,Coffee agroforest; Tree dynamics; Native trees,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; FOREST; DISTURBANCE; POPULATION; ABUNDANCE; FARMS,,"[Sathish, B.

Two linear regression equations, one using basal area (BA, Method 1) and the other using BA and height (Method 2) were followed. On using method 1, the AGB varied from 39.69 to 170.02 Mg ha(-1) and by method 2, it varied from 73.06 to 173.10 Mg ha(-1). The relationship between BA and AGB yielded a positive correlation for all the five sites of inland and coastal areas. The basic wood specific gravity of 41 tree species determined by oven-dry weight by volume, ranged from 0.46 to 0.92 g cm(-3) for inland sites and 0.47 to 0.89 g cm(-3) for the coastal sites. The AGB estimation obtained in this study represents a more realistic picture of biomass of tropical dry evergreen forests, because a relatively large area was sampled. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,A1986,382,1987,Altered stand structure and tree allometry reduce carbon storage in evergreen forest fragments in India's Western Ghats,"Tropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.

(ii) What are the levels of CD and CA in the stem component of tree species in the mono- and multi-specific stands? (iii) Which vegetation characteristics strongly account for the variations in CD and CA in the tree species in the mono- and multi-specific stands? We established 15 stands (six mono- and nine multi-specific stands), each having 4 ha area in the forest region. Total number of species across the stands was 46 belonging to 25 families. Average tree density ha(-1) and stem basal area (BA, m(2) ha(-1)), across the stands were 522 and 11.1, respectively. Margalef s index of species richness (SR), Whittaker's index of species evenness (Ew) and Shannon-Wiener index (H') were greater at multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. Average wood specific gravity (WSG) across species for the mono-specific (Teak) was greatest compared to the other categories. Across the mono- and multi-specific stands, WSG among species ranged between 0.47 and 0.79 g cm(-3), with 26.2% having WSG >= 0.70 g cm(-3). Across the plots in mono- and multi-specific stands, stem density showed positive correlation with BA and aboveground stem biomass (AGB). The associations of SR with Ew and H', and Ew with H' were significantly positive. The AGB was positively associated with SR, Ew and BA. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant effects of year, stand and species for DBH, height and AGB. Average aboveground CD and CA across the stands were 136 t-C ha(-1) and 53 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Results of step-wise multiple regression indicated that across the stands, CD was influenced by BA and H', and CA was affected by SR and BA. Principal component analysis exhibited strong association of CA and CD with multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. Teak and Sal trees showed maximum CA per unit BA at multi-specific stand compared to mono-specific stand. These findings can be used by the forest managers to increase the carbon density and accumulation in Teak and Sal forests of India. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our research is one of the first study focusing on the statistical evaluation of the cross-cultural analysis between three different communities i.e., Dard, Kashmiri and Gujjar, of the study area. Sampling was carried out in eight villages in 2017 to 2020, and data were collected from 102 informants based on walking transects, to collect plant specimens, and semi-structured interviews. The medical usages of all collected taxa were grouped into 15 disease categories and 81 biomedical ailments. In this study, we documented around 107 plant taxa belonging to 52 families from the local inhabitants of the Kashmir Himalaya, which regulate the livelihood of the people and support cultural ecosystem services. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Ranunculaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae, Polygonaceae, Plantaginaceae and Brassicaceae are the top most dominant families. Herbaceous groups of plants were more common than trees and shrubs, and 71.96% of herb taxa were employed as medicine. Liliaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Portulacaceae (FUV = 0.24 each) have the highest family use value (FUV). The most prominent family was Asteraceae (seven genera, nine taxa), followed by Rosaceae and Lamiaceae (six genera, six taxa each). Persicaria Mill., Rheum L., Aconitum L. and Artemisia L. were prominent genera. Valeriana jatamansi Jones ex Roxb. (47UR), Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don (45UR), Arisaema jacquemontii Blume (37UR), Asparagus racemosus Willd. (36UR) and Rumex acetosa L. (35UR) were the most important plant taxa with reference to use-reports. The ethnomedicinal applications of Aesculus indica Wall. ex Cambess., Solanum pseudocapsicum L., Ranunculus hirtellus Royle and Cormus domestica (L.) Spach plant taxa are reported here for the first time from the Himalayan Kashmiri people. We recommend further research on ethnopharmacological application of these newly recorded ethnobotanical plants. The medical usage of the plant was limited to different parts of the plant. In terms of the usage percentage, whole plant (26.17%), leaves (24.30%) and roots (19.63%) were found to have the highest utilization. The powder form (40.19%) was the most frequently employed method of drug/medicine preparation, followed by the utilization of extracted juice and/or other extracts (22.43%). The ICF values range from 0.85 to 1.00. Their use to remedy parasitic problems (PAR) and insect bites (IB) (ICF = 1.0 each) had the maximum consensus mentioned by the informants, although the number of taxa employed under this category was very limited. The different plant taxa used for the treatment of the gastrointestinal problems (GAS) was the most prominent disease category (262 URs, 16.19%, 25 taxa, ICF = 0.90). About 65% of the plant taxa studied is indigenous to the Asia or Himalayan regions, and around 35% is found to be exotic in nature. A strong positive correlation was found between age, gender, educational qualification and medicinal plant knowledge. No significant association was between people of different communities interviewed in terms of medical knowledge of the plants, p = 0.347 (>0.05) and Ï‡2 = 2.120.

The aim of the present study was to determine aboveground biomass of trees in the Pachaimalai forest of the Eastern Ghats in India. A sum of 5388 trees representing 131 species were recorded in twenty four transects (0.5 ha each) sampled from Pachaimalai. The total aboveground biomass stock for the 12 ha sampled was 608.2 tonnes. The average biomass value per transect was 25.3 +/- 5.6 t/0.5 ha, and it ranged from 4.2 to 103.5 t/0.5 ha. The average species richness, density and basal area per transect were 22 +/- 1.7 (species/0.5 ha), 225 +/- 9.5 (trees/0.5 ha) and 6.3 +/- 1.0 (m(2)/0.5 ha) respectively. Among the 131 species, Nothopegia heyneana (Anacardiaceae) contributed the maximum (19.1%) to the total forest biomass followed by Canthium dicoccum var. dicoccum, Albizia amara, Gyrocarpus asiaticus and Schleichera oleosa. Linear regression analysis showed that forest biomass increased with the increase in basal area (R-2 = 0.979) and species richness (R-2 = 0.702), but not with density (R-2 = 0.320). The aboveground biomass of Pachaimalai forest falls within the range reported for other tropical forests of the world.

,,,A2389,389,2390,"Ethnomedicinal and ecological status of plants in Garhwal Himalaya, India","Background: The northern part of India harbours a great diversity of medicinal plants due to its distinct geography and ecological marginal conditions. The traditional medical systems of northern India are part of a time tested culture and honored still by people today. These traditional systems have been curing complex disease for more than 3,000 years. With rapidly growing demand for these medicinal plants, most of the plant populations have been depleted, indicating a lack of ecological knowledge among communities using the plants. Thus, an attempt was made in this study to focus on the ecological status of ethnomedicinal plants, to determine their availability in the growing sites, and to inform the communities about the sustainable exploitation of medicinal plants in the wild. Methods: The ecological information regarding ethnomedicinal plants was collected in three different climatic regions (tropical, sub-tropical and temperate) for species composition in different forest layers. The ecological information was assessed using the quadrate sampling method. A total of 25 quadrats, 10 x 10 m were laid out at random in order to sample trees and shrubs, and 40 quadrats of 1 x 1 m for herbaceous plants. In each climatic region, three vegetation sites were selected for ecological information; the mean values of density, basal cover, and the importance value index from all sites of each region were used to interpret the final data. Ethnomedicinal uses were collected from informants of adjacent villages. About 10% of inhabitants (older, experienced men and women) were interviewed about their use of medicinal plants. A consensus analysis of medicinal plant use between the different populations was conducted. Results: Across the different climatic regions a total of 57 species of plants were reported: 14 tree species, 10 shrub species, and 33 herb species. In the tropical and sub-tropical regions, Acacia catechu was the dominant tree while Ougeinia oojeinensis in the tropical region and Terminalia belerica in the sub-tropical region were least dominant reported. In the temperate region, Quercus leucotrichophora was the dominant tree and Pyrus pashia the least dominant tree. A total of 10 shrubs were recorded in all three regions: Adhatoda vasica was common species in the tropical and sub-tropical regions however, Rhus parviflora was common species in the sub-tropical and temperate regions. Among the 33 herbs, Sida cordifolia was dominant in the tropical and sub-tropical regions, while Barleria prionitis the least dominant in tropical and Phyllanthus amarus in the sub-tropical region. In temperate region, Vernonia anthelmintica was dominant and Imperata cylindrica least dominant. The consensus survey indicated that the inhabitants have a high level of agreement regarding the usages of single plant. The index value was high (1.0) for warts, vomiting, carminative, pain, boils and antiseptic uses, and lowest index value (0.33) was found for bronchitis. Conclusion: The medicinal plants treated various ailments. These included diarrhea, dysentery, bronchitis, menstrual disorders, gonorrhea, pulmonary affections, migraines, leprosy. The ecological studies showed that the tree density and total basal cover increased from the tropical region to sub-tropical and temperate regions. The species composition changed with climatic conditions. Among the localities used for data collection in each climatic region, many had very poor vegetation cover.

These forests experienced intensive commercial logging for an extended period (>100 years). To discontinue disintegration and improve the diversity and regeneration, these were declared protective and consequently all silvicultural activities were abandoned. For this, species richness and regeneration were studied in the context of overstorey structure, employing nested quadrat method. Out of 130 species reported in the earliest-most study from these forests, only 68 species were recorded here. Change in community composition has taken place with Mallotus philippensis becoming dominant in one community; this association is new for these forests. Effect of overstorey structure was noticeable, highest species richness and diversity were increasing with a decrease in tree density and basal area. These forests showed impaired regeneration progression; for all the groups there was a wide gap between the seedlings and saplings conversion to advance stages. Prospects of recovery are fair as several tree species were reported in juvenile stages with adequate density. Results demonstrated that conversion of forests having a long history of exploitation to protected forest is initially good, but for successful recovery, after a restitution time, it is desirable to emulate intermediate disturbance by selective harvesting of old and malformed trees.

The study was conducted in an undisturbed wet evergreen forest in India. We selected three plots situated on gentle slopes and three plots situated on steep slopes. Tree growth was considered as mean annual diameter increment. Stand structure was considered in relation to several characteristics: trunk diameter distributions, tree heights, and spatial distributions of stems and crowns. Except for the spatial structure, analyses were performed on samples including either all the species or only the dominant species (Vateria indica L.). Diameter growth varied according to slope intensity and to tree size: growth of large trees was clearly higher on steep slopes whereas growth of small trees proved lower or similar. Diameter distributions were different among the six plots, but the difference cannot be related to slope intensity. On the contrary, tree heights differed according to slope intensity: for a given diameter, trees were taller on gentle slopes than on steep slopes. Finally, stem spatial distributions showed strong regularity on gentle slopes whereas they were random on steep slopes. The observed changes between gentle and steep slopes suggest differences at tree level through a modification of its shape, but also differences in the major processes responsible for stand dynamics: competition, establishment and survival.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467403006096,2003,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Robert, A; Moravie, MA",,,Asia; atmospheric emissions; biomass burning,TRACE-P EXPERIMENT; CHEMICAL EVOLUTION; PACIFIC; AEROSOL; INVENTORY; TRANSPORT; OUTFLOW; DISTRIBUTIONS; FIRES; GAS,United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory; University of Iowa,"Argonne Natl Lab, Decis & Informat Sci Div, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; Univ Iowa, Ctr Global & Reg Environm Res, Iowa City, IA 52240 USA","Streets, DG (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Decis & Informat Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",,Bronze,,,,,,,,,

Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpson's dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielou's evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpson's dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 10-50 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication.

,,,A2322,393,2323,Assessing aboveground tropical forest biomass using Google Earth canopy images,"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in efforts to combat climate change requires participating countries to periodically assess their forest resources on a national scale. Such a process is particularly challenging in the tropics because of technical difficulties related to large aboveground forest biomass stocks, restricted availability of affordable, appropriate remote-sensing images, and a lack of accurate forest inventory data. In this paper, we apply the Fourier-based FOTO method of canopy texture analysis to Google Earth's very-high-resolution images of the wet evergreen forests in the Western Ghats of India in order to (1) assess the predictive power of the method on aboveground biomass of tropical forests, (2) test the merits of free Google Earth images relative to their native commercial IKONOS counterparts and (3) highlight further research needs for affordable, accurate regional aboveground biomass estimations. We used the FOTO method to ordinate Fourier spectra of 1436 square canopy images (1253125 m) with respect to a canopy grain texture gradient (i.e., a combination of size distribution and spatial pattern of tree crowns), benchmarked against virtual canopy scenes simulated from a set of known forest structure parameters and a 3-D light interception model. We then used 15 1-ha ground plots to demonstrate that both texture gradients provided by Google Earth and IKONOS images strongly correlated with field-observed stand structure parameters such as the density of large trees, total basal area, and aboveground biomass estimated from a regional allometric model. Our results highlight the great potential of the FOTO method applied to Google Earth data for biomass retrieval because the texture-biomass relationship is only subject to 15% relative error, on average, and does not show obvious saturation trends at large biomass values.

,,,A0046,394,47,"A non-destructive approach to develop tree-level allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass in the forests of Tripura, Northeast India","Forest tree biomass estimation is a significant issue for the forest management system and to mitigate climate change. Aboveground biomass (AGB) is an indicator of the potential productivity of the ecosystem. However, an accurate estimation method of carbon stock is important for perfect carbon accounting. So, selecting a more appropriate method for biomass assessment is crucial to reaching the goal. Though allometric equations have been used to estimate AGB for both individual species as well as multiple species for regional and pan-tropical scales, species-specific models for a smaller area produce better accuracy. The current initiative has been taken to develop individual tree-level species-specific and generalized local allometric models in a non-destructive manner for the Tripura state of Northeast India, which was the main limitation of carbon stock estimation in the region. Five different forms of log-transformed linearized power equations were tested in the regression models, with AGB as the response variable. The best fit models were chosen based on adjusted R2, F-statistic, Akaike information criterion, Breusch-Pagan test, Variance Inflation Factor, and three assumptions of linearity. A paired t test was conducted between the predicted and observed AGB values. The best fit generalized equation developed in this study was found to be AGB = 1.03 × exp (− 3.95 + 1.09 ln D2 + 0.97 ln H − 0.20 N). Compared with some existing pan-tropical and regional models for their predictive accuracy, this equation expressed the highest R2 value of 0.9089 in an independent testing dataset. When measuring the tree height is difficult due to a closed canopy, the equation AGB = 1.07 × exp (− 2.77 + 2.55 ln D) can be applied to obtain a quick estimation using just the DBH. The equations presented here may be the instrument for estimating carbon stock at the local level.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42965-022-00280-8,NA,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Roy, AD; Das, SK; Debnath, B",,,Aboveground biomass; Allometric equation; Belowground biomass; Carbon stock; Tropical dry deciduous forest; Wood specific gravity,ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; ERROR PROPAGATION; DENSITY,Dr. Hari Singh Gour University,"[Pati, Pranab Kumar; Kaushik, Priya; Khan, M.

,,,C0179,395,3355,Mapping of realized and fundamental niches of threatened tree species using geoinformatics: a species level approach for sustaining biodiversity,"In order to ensure that threatened species are included in the conservation of our biological diversity, it is necessary to prioritise species and thus by landscape or implement measure for prioritised area. This requires geographical data specifying the places where threatened plants grow and the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. The fundamental niche can be viewed as the set of environmental conditions and resources that allow a given species to survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions. To survive and avoid competition for the same resources, a species usually occupies only a part of its fundamental niche in a particular community or ecosystem — that is its realized niche. Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations or the qualitative descriptions of environmental variables with which they are associated. In the present study realized niches of the threatened plant species of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were gathered using Global Positioning System (GPS) and distribution and abundance of each species were measured by stratified random sampling techniques. The realized niches of each threatened species were gathered by GPS and inductive habitat suitability assessment modelling has been done in Geographic Information System (GIS) along with environmental, edaphic, topographic and phytosociological data for their fundamental niche. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with eight threatened species. The distribution of each threatened species, their realized niches and its status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped. This will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements; particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),2010,NA,"AO Varghese, AK Joshi, YVNK Murthy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2209,396,2210,The Cost-Utility of Telemedicine to Screen for Diabetic Retinopathy in India,"Purpose: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program in rural Southern India that conducts 1-off screening camps (i.e., screening offered once) in villages and to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different screening intervals. Design: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model. Participants: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 rural diabetic patients aged 40 years who had not been previously screened for DR and who were followed over a 25-year period in Chennai, India. Methods: We interviewed 249 people with diabetes using the time trade-off method to estimate utility values associated with DR. Patient and provider costs of telemedicine screening and hospital-based DR treatment were estimated through interviews with 100 diabetic patients, sampled when attending screening in rural camps (n = 50) or treatment at the base hospital in Chennai (n = 50), and with program and hospital managers. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR screening test were assessed in comparison with diagnosis using a gold standard method for 346 diabetic patients. Other model parameters were derived from the literature. A Markov model was developed in TreeAge Pro 2009 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA) using these data. Main Outcome Measures: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the current teleophthalmology program of 1-off screening in comparison with no screening program and the cost-utility of this program at different screening intervals. Results: By using the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness, the current rural teleophthalmology program was cost-effective ($1320 per QALY) compared with no screening from a health provider perspective. Screening intervals of up to a frequency of screening every 2 years also were cost-effective, but annual screening was not (>$3183 per QALY). From a societal perspective, telescreening up to a frequency of once every 5 years was cost-effective, but not more frequently. Conclusions: From a health provider perspective, a 1-off DR telescreening program is cost-effective compared with no screening in this rural Indian setting. Increasing the frequency of screening up to 2 years also is cost-effective. The results are dependent on the administrative costs of establishing and maintaining screening at regular intervals and on achieving sufficient coverage.

,,,A2553,397,2554,Comparative Genome Analysis Provides Insights into the Evolution and Adaptation of Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi on Aesculus hippocastanum,"A recently emerging bleeding canker disease, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi (Pae), is threatening European horse chestnut in northwest Europe. Very little is known about the origin and biology of this new disease. We used the nucleotide sequences of seven commonly used marker genes to investigate the phylogeny of three strains isolated recently from bleeding stem cankers on European horse chestnut in Britain (E-Pae). On the basis of these sequences alone, the E-Pae strains were identical to the Pae type-strain (I-Pae), isolated from leaf spots on Indian horse chestnut in India in 1969. The phylogenetic analyses also showed that Pae belongs to a distinct clade of P. syringae pathovars adapted to woody hosts. We generated genome-wide Illumina sequence data from the three E-Pae strains and one strain of I-Pae. Comparative genomic analyses revealed pathovar-specific genomic regions in Pae potentially implicated in virulence on a tree host, including genes for the catabolism of plant-derived aromatic compounds and enterobactin synthesis. Several gene clusters displayed intra-pathovar variation, including those encoding type IV secretion, a novel fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and a sucrose uptake pathway. Rates of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the four Pae genomes indicate that the three E-Pae strains diverged from each other much more recently than they diverged from I-Pae. The very low genetic diversity among the three geographically distinct E-Pae strains suggests that they originate from a single, recent introduction into Britain, thus highlighting the serious environmental risks posed by the spread of an exotic plant pathogenic bacterium to a new geographic location. The genomic regions in Pae that are absent from other P. syringae pathovars that infect herbaceous hosts may represent candidate genetic adaptations to infection of the woody parts of the tree.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010224,2010,PLOS ONE,"Green, S; Studholme, DJ; Laue, BE; Dorati, F; Lovell, H; Arnold, D; Cottrell, JE; Bridgett, S; Blaxter, M; Huitema, E; Thwaites, R; Sharp, PM; Jackson, RW; Kamoun, S",,,Intra-annual variations; teak; oxygen isotope,TECTONA-GRANDIS; NORTHERN THAILAND; LEAF WATER; TREE-RINGS; RATIOS; ENRICHMENT; RECORDS; LEAVES; CARBON; DELTA-O-18,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)","[Managave, S.

The dose association of sacred forests with local people represents a community-based, participatory approach to conservation. Our quantitative analysis in five sites documented 78 tree species of 66 genera and 33 families. Tree density and species diversity were higher than previously reported for the forests of the Eastern Ghats, India. Population structure and regeneration potential in four out of five study sites showed a higher percentage of density in the seedling and sapling layers, demonstrating that these sites are regenerating. However, in the Gugarpat sacred forest, the population structure revealed large numbers of mature trees with a stable population structure. In our study, large proportions of species had either poor regeneration potential or were not regenerating. Hence, management strategies are needed to conserve these species. Our study documents the diversity, population patterns, and regeneration of the tree species of five sacred forests, which may help in further management and conservation of the biodiversity of sacred forests in India and globally.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2018.1522148,2019,ECOSCIENCE,"Pradhan, A; Ormsby, A; Behera, N",,,Heritability; genetic advance; growth attributes; cluster composition; agroforestry,EUCALYPTUS-GRANDIS; CLONAL TRIALS; GROWTH TRAITS,Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"[Parthiban, K.

Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF - small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD - round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha(-1)) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha(-)1) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems ha(-)1) in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m(2) ha(-1)), intermediate (66.9 m(2)) in SF and least (61.7 m(2)) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The species-area curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse 'J' shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008949407385,1999,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Parthasarathy, N",,,multi-purpose trees; site-specific growth; nitrogen-use-efficiency; shoot/root ratio; transplantation performance,FAMILIES; BIOMASS,Madurai Kamaraj University,"Madurai Kamaraj Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Madurai 625021, Tamil Nadu, India","Paliwal, K (corresponding author), Madurai Kamaraj Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Madurai 625021, Tamil Nadu, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Field measurement (GBH, LAI, litter, soil moisture) was carried out over ten quadrates of 0.1ha in KNP for characterization of biophysical parameters with specified measurement protocol and sampling. Satellite based remote sensing analysis (LAI, Phenology, and NPP) was carried out using multi date observations of IRS-LISS-III, IMS-1MX, SPOT-VEGETATION and EOS-MODIS instruments. Rank correlation analysis using field data collected in the selected quadrates at KNP showed Sal (Shorea robusta) is dominant forest species followed by Lendia, Jamun (Syzygium cumini), Saja, Harra and Dhawda etc. Field measurement of Sal showed GBH range from 20 cm to 170 cm. Different forest classes such as Sal; Sal mixed with Jamun, Bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) etc, including grasslands/scrubland were classified with overall accuracy of 85.56 percent using March, May and October multi spectral data. Sal has distinct growth characteristics (low vegetation growth/leaf fall in March instead of May) as compared to other vegetation species. As per the Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurement using hemispherical photographs, Sal showed the highest LAI (6.95 m(2)/m(2)) during September and lowest LAI (2.63 m(2)/m(2)) during March. Overall good agreement (r=0.79) was found between the LAI generated from LISS-III and MODIS data product.

In this study, the forest phytomass has been assessed in range of subtropical and temperate forest dominated by tree species of Quercus semicarpifolia Sm. and Pinus roxburghii Sarg in Himalayan region Purola tehsil in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand state of India. In-situ measurements of the phytomass were taken with clustered sampling approach on a total of 40 plots (0.1 ha each), i.e. in 10 MODIS pixels with 4 plots laid in an individual pixel. The field measured phytomass was found in the range of 67.76 - 1,108 t ha(-1). Weighted-area phytomass was estimated at an individual MODIS (MOD13Q1, 250m) pixel where in-situ measurements varied from 207.93 t ha(-1) - 1,042 t ha(-1). The best fit equation of pixel phytomass values was regressed on red, infra-red and vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from the MODIS data. The correlation between the measured phytomass and NDVI was found significant and maximum in the month of December (R value -0.71, p < 0.01). However, such a relationship was not persistent throughout the year. The R-2 value between observed phytomass and predicted phytomass was 0.53. The predicted phytomass based on 250x250 m MODIS data varied from 216.88 - 1,011 t ha(-1).

,,,A0832,403,833,"Biomass and carbon stocks in mangrove ecosystems of Kerala, southwest coast of India","Abstract Background Mangroves are important tropical carbon sinks, and their role in mitigating climate change is well documented across the globe. However, the ecosystem carbon stocks in the mangroves of India have not been studied comprehensively. Data from this region is very limited for providing sufficient insights and authentic evaluation of carbon stocks on a regional scale. In this study, we evaluated the ecosystem carbon stock and its spatial variation in mangroves of Kerala, southwest coast of India. Results The mean biomass stored in mangrove vegetation of Kerala is 117.11 Â± 1.02 t/ha (ABG= 80.22 Â± 0.80, BGB =36.89 Â± 0.23 t/ha). Six mangrove species were found distributed in the study area. Among the different species, Avicennia marina had the highest biomass (162.18 t/ha) and least biomass was observed in Sonneratia alba (0.61 t/ha). The mean ecosystem carbon stock of mangrove systems in Kerala was estimated to be 139.82 t/ha, equivalent to 513.13 t CO 2 e/ha with the vegetation and soil storing 58.56 t C/ha and 81.26 t C/ha respectively. Conclusion The present study reveals thatÂ Kerala mangroves store sizable volume of carbon and therefore need to be preserved and managed sustainably, to retain along with the increase in carbon storage. This features the need of broadening mangrove cover as well as restoring deteriorated land in the past 50â€‰years. Although mangrove forests in this region are protected by the Kerala Forest Department, they have been frequently facing illegal encroachment, prawn cultivation, and coastal erosion.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-020-00227-8,2020,ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Harishma, KM; Sandeep, S; Sreekumar, VB",,,"Van Vihar National Park, Central India; PM2.5 mass; Source apportionment; Secondary sulfate; Combustion aerosol; Local and regional source locations",POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; SOURCE IDENTIFICATION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; INORGANIC-IONS; AIR-POLLUTION; AMBIENT AIR; AEROSOL; PARTICLES; CARBON; EUROPE,Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal,"[Kumar, Samresh; Raman, Ramya Sunder] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bhopal Bypass Rd, Bhopal 462066, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Raman, Ramya Sunder] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Ctr ForRes Environm & Sustainable Technol, Bhopal Bypass Rd, Bhopal 462066, Madhya Pradesh, India","Raman, RS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Bhopal Bypass Rd, Bhopal 462066, Madhya Pradesh, India.","Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India [MoES/16/09/10-RDEAS]; IISER Bhopal",Bronze,,,,,,,,,

In the Bhoramdeo wildlife sanctuary of central India, four locations differing in anthropogenic disturbances were selected. At each location, three homogeneous plots were marked to study tree species composition, diversity and regeneration against anthropogenic pressure. Within each plot 10 quadrats of 10 x 10 m in size were established and diameter of all stems of each species for each life stage was determined. From the entire 1.2 ha areas total 65 species, 273890 stems and 23.8 m(2) ha(-1) basal area (>= 30 cm height) were recorded. Anthropogenic disturbances changed species composition, limited regeneration and reduced species diversity. Bray-Curtis analysis of each life cycle stage for each location suggested temporal dynamism in species composition. Study showed negative relationship between seedlings species diversity and conservation focussed species populations. The negative relationships of pole's species number and stems with averaged tree canopy size, and disturbance scores with seedling's species number, Shannon index, and that of pole's stem suggested for selective harvesting of old age trees in addition to stop the practice of harvesting of juveniles for sustainable management of protected forests of dry tropics.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2017,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Baboo, B; Sagar, R; Bargali, SS; Verma, H",,,fragmentation; old-growth tree species; regeneration; seed dispersal; tropical forests; Western Ghats,EVERGREEN FOREST; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; UTTARA KANNADA; BIODIVERSITY; RECRUITMENT; DIVERSITY; IMPACT; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; SITES,Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS); Pondicherry University,"[Osuri, Anand M.; Mudappa, Divya; Raman, T.

,,,A0613,405,614,Quantifying carbon stocks and sequestration potential in agroforestry systems under divergent management scenarios relevant to India's Nationally Determined Contribution,"n many countries including India, perennialization of agricultural lands, afforestation and reforestation have often been proposed to address land degradation and mitigate climate change. Among the various perennialization options, agroforestry holds a great potential for creating carbon (C) sinks and mitigating emissions from agriculture, while also increasing adaptive capacity. However, information is scanty on the C sink potential of agroforestry in the different climatic and altitudinal zones of India that are suitable for agroforestry. Therefore, the objectives of this analysis were to (1) quantify variations in biomass C and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in the major agroforestry practices along climatic zones and altitudinal gradients, and (2) provide projections of the C sequestration potential in areas that are highly suitable for agroforestry in India. Biomass C stocks were higher in agrosilvopastoral (73.4 Mg C ha-1) than in agrisilvicultural (42.6 Mg C ha−1) and silvopastoral systems (42.7 Mg C ha−1). Similarly, SOC stocks were higher in agrosilvopastoral (53.0 Mg C ha−1) than in agrisilvicultural (44.1 Mg C ha−1) and silvopastoral systems (33.5 Mg C ha−1). Agroforestry systems in humid zones had significantly higher total biomass C stocks (97.9 Mg C ha−1) and SOC stocks (51.8 Mg C ha−1). SOC stocks were significantly higher under agroforestry in medium (51.2 Mg C ha−1) than in high (46.7 Mg C ha−1) and low (32.7 Mg C ha−1) altitudes. Assuming no significant change in area under agrisilvicultural, agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems, the total C sequestered by 2050 was projected to be 4.2, 4.5 and 1.5 Pg CO2 eq, respectively. With an increase in 5% of current area at 5-years intervals, the total CO2 eq sequestered by 2050 was estimated at 5.4 Pg in agrisilvicultural, 5.8 Pg in agrosilvopastoral and 1.9 Pg in silvopastoral systems. It is concluded that expansion of the area under agroforestry by a mere 30% has the potential to offset significant proportions of India’s total emissions by 2050.

The work also intended to study the variation in the proportion of lianas with trees along an altitudinal gradient and to compare the functional traits of lianas and trees sharing similar environmental conditions. All lianas >= 1.5 cm diameter and trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height were measured and included the inventory. A total of 237 liana species were enumerated across the four forest types. The species richness of lianas per hectare was maximum at semi-evergreen forest (31 +/- 5.3) and minimum at dry evergreen forest sites (21 +/- 3.9). Semi-evergreen forest sites of Eastern Ghats also had the highest density (648 +/- 152.7 ha(-1)) of liana stems and wet-evergreen forest sites of Western Ghats registered the lowest (261 +/- 86.7 ha(-1)). Dry evergreen forest sites on the Coromandel Coast recorded the highest basal area (0.75 +/- 0.44 m(2) ha(-1)) and the above ground biomass (22.77 +/- 19.1 Mg ha(-1)) of lianas across the study sites followed by the semi-evergreen forest sites (0.69 +/- 0.3 m(2) ha(-1) and 10.01 +/- 6.2 Mg ha(-1)). The proportion of liana species richness to total woody species decreased along the altitudinal gradient in the present study. Majority of lianas in the study sites were brevi-deciduous by plant type except in wet-evergreen forest sites. Stem twining was the chief climbing mechanism by species richness and scramblers formed the most abundant liana group by abundance. Majority of lianas had microphyllous leaves, whereas trees had mesophyllous leaves as their predominant leaf type. Flowers of SEF and SDF sites were mostly conspicuous, while the flowers of DEF sites were largely inconspicuous.

To understand how shifts in rainfall may alter these carbon pools, above-ground biomass (AGB), soil organic carbon (SOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) of tropical forest covers were measured across a rainfall gradient (543-1590 mm) in Gujarat (India), a state falling under semi arid to tropical dry-wet conditions. Species diversity, tree density and soil texture were also measured. Field visits and data collection were carried out for 2 years (2009-2011) in 95 plots of 250 x 250 m in the forest covers across four distinct rainfall zones (RFZs). Data analysis showed that differences seen in the values of the measured parameters across the RFZs are statistically significant (P < 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between mean annual precipitation (MAP) and tree density, species diversity, AGB, SOC, and MBC. Across the RFZs, AGB ranged between 0.09 and 168.28 Mg ha(-1); SOC values (up to 25 cm soil depth) varied between 2.94 and 147.84 Mg ha(-1). Soil texture and MBC showed a significant impact on the dynamics of SOC in all the RFZs. MBC is more influenced by SOC rather than AGB. Both vegetation type and MAP have an important role in the regulation of SOC in tropical soils.

In Nepal, the deer is confined to protected areas throughout the Himalaya. It is a solitary and shy forest dweller with a crepuscular activity pattern. It prefers and repeatedly uses one or more specific defecation sites. Such behaviour is believed to function in chemical communication among individuals. This study was conducted in Neshyang valley in the Annapurna Conservation Area, and aims to evaluate how musk deer selects the latrine site in its habitat taking into account both biotic and abiotic factors. In order to achieve this aim, we laid out a total of 23 transects of 500m length throughout the study area. Within each transect, 20mx20m nested structured quadrats were located at an interval of 100m.

Biological Richness (BR) index, described elsewhere as a cumulative property of ecological habitats and surroundings; was analyzed as an integrated 'three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis. For validation, we categorized the field plots into 10-groups corresponding to 10-levels of BR using data splitting technique using their GPS-recorded positional information. In general, the number of tree, shrub and liana species and mean BA demonstrated a decreasing trend with lowering of BR for all three states falling under both the hotspots. However, the number of endemic species increased with decrease in BR levels for Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh; and decreased for the state of Assam. The study validates the BR index derived using geospatial modeling approach, thereby provides confidence in its acceptance for ecological conservation purposes.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12524-010-0044-4,2010,JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING,"Behera, MD; Roy, PS",,,Garo Hills; North-east India; Protected area network; Wildlife corridors; Zone of influence; Shifting cultivation; Jhum,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; FORESTS; PATTERN,United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Wildlife Institute of India,"[Kumar, A.] JalaSRI Watershed Surveillance & Res Inst, Jalgaon 425002, Maharashtra, India; [Marcot, B.

This study assesses the potential of multitemporal L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data to improve forest AGB estimation using the three-parameter water cloud model (WCM) trained with field data from relatively small (0.1 ha) plots. The major objective is to assess the impact of the high uncertainties in field inventory data due to relatively smaller plot size and temporal gap between acquisitions and ground truth on the AGB estimation. This study analyzes a time series of twenty-three ALOS-2 dual-polarized images spanning 5 years acquired under different weather and soil moisture conditions over a subtropical forest test site in India. The WCM model is trained and validated on individual acquisitions to retrieve forest AGB. The accuracy of the generated AGB products is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE). Further, we use a multitemporal AGB retrieval approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated AGB. Changes in precipitation and soil moisture affect the AGB retrieval accuracy from individual acquisitions; however, using multitemporal data, these effects are mitigated. Using a multitemporal AGB retrieval strategy, the accuracy improves by 15% (55Â Mg/ha RMSE) for all field plots and by 21% (39Â Mg/ha RMSE) for forests with AGB less than 100Â Mg/ha. The analysis shows that any ten multitemporal acquisitions spanning 5Â years are sufficient for improving AGB retrieval accuracy over the considered test site. Furthermore, we use allometry from colocated field plots and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L2A height metrics to produce GEDI-derived AGB estimates. Despite the limited co-location of GEDI and field data over our study area, within the period of interest, the preliminary analysis shows the potential of jointly using the GEDI-derived AGB and multi-temporal ALOS-2 data for large-scale AGB retrieval.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.752254,2021,FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Khati, U; Lavalle, M; Singh, G",,,diversity index; C storage; litterfall; biomass production; remote sensing,NEOTROPICAL FOREST; CARBON DENSITY; CANOPY TRAITS; ACCUMULATION; LEAF; REFLECTANCE; ALLOCATION; DIVERSITY; HIMALAYAS; NITROGEN,Indira Gandhi National Tribal University; Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"[Thakur, Tarun K.; Patel, Digvesh K.; Thakur, Anita; Kumar, Anirudh] Indira Gandhi Natl Tribal Univ, Amarkantak, India; [Bijalwan, Arvind A.] VCSG Uttarakhand Univ Hort & Forestry, Coll Forestry, Tehri Garhwal, India; [Bhat, Jahangeer A.; Dobriyal, M.

Lowest average bulk density (D-b) of 0.95 was found same in S3 (sigma +/- 0.07) and S5 (sigma +/- 0.09) and highest D-b (1.08) was observed in S2 (sigma +/- 0.05). A relatively higher coarse fraction was observed in all the six strata ranging from 19.23 (SD +/- 4.66) in S3 to 29.37 (sigma +/- 6.12) in S6. Soil pH ranged from 6.09 (sigma +/- 0.64) in S4 to 6.97 (sigma +/- 0.53) in S2. The region under biotic interference has observed significant deforestation and degradation in the past two decades leading to lower SOC% values compared to other studies in the adjoining regions of Indian Himalayas and temperate coniferous forests in general. SOC% values were observed to range from 1.03 (sigma +/- 0.22) in S2 to 2.25 (sigma +/- 0.23) in S3. SOC density ranged between 25.11 (sigma +/- 5.41) t ha(-1) in S2 and 51.93 (sigma +/- 5.24) t ha(-1) in S3.

A significant variation was observed in SOC density within strata. SOC density values in closed strata in general exceed to those in open strata. Primary results indicate that the average SOC stock for all the strata is low due to continuous biotic pressure in the last two decades making it a potential region for SOC buildup under plus options of REDD + (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) which includes conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon (C) stocks.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9466-y,2014,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,"Wani, AA; Joshi, PK; Singh, O; Bhat, JA",,,forest; Shannon Index; species richness; RS and GIS; land use; NDVI,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; VEGETATION; INDIA; CLASSIFICATION; LANDSAT; PATTERN; GIS,Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (IGKV),"[Thakur, Tarun; Swamy, S.

Our study was carried out in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area (BCA), the second-largest mangrove area in eastern India. We assessed total ecosystem carbon (C) stocks at four land use types representing varying degree of disturbances. Ranked in order of increasing impacts, these sites included dense mangrove forests, scrub mangroves, restored/planted mangroves, and abandoned aquaculture ponds. These impacts include both natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances causing stress, degradation, and destruction of mangroves. Mean vegetation C stocks (including both above-and belowground pools; mean +/- standard error) in aquaculture, planted, scrub, and dense mangroves were 0, 7 +/- 4, 65 +/- 11 and 100 +/- 11 Mg C/ha, respectively. Average soil C pools for aquaculture, planted, scrub, and dense mangroves were 61 +/- 8, 92 +/- 20, 177 +/- 14, and 134 +/- 17 Mg C/ha, respectively. Mangrove soils constituted largest fraction of total ecosystem C stocks at all sampled sites (aquaculture [100%], planted [90%], scrub [72%], and dense mangrove [57%]). Within BCA, the four studied land use types covered an area of similar to 167 km(2) and the total ecosystem C stocks were 0.07 Tg C for aquaculture (similar to 12 km(2)), 0.25 Tg C for planted/restored mangrove (similar to 24 km(2)), 2.29 teragrams (Tg) Tg C for scrub (similar to 93 km(2)), and 0.89 Tg C for dense mangroves (similar to 38 km(2)). Although BCA is protected under Indian wildlife protection and conservation laws, similar to 150 000 people inhabit this area and are directly or indirectly dependent on mangrove resources for sustenance. Estimates of C stocks of Bhitarkanika mangroves and recognition of their role as a C repository could provide an additional reason to support conservation and restoration of Bhitarkanika mangroves. Harvesting or destructive exploitation of mangroves by local communities for economic gains can potentially be minimized by enabling these communities to avail themselves of carbon offset/conservation payments under approved climate change mitigation strategies and actions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1890/15-2143,2016,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Bhomia, RK; MacKenzie, RA; Murdiyarso, D; Sasmito, SD; Purbopuspito, J",,,Soil moisture; validation; satellite; analysis,WETNESS; IMPACT; SCALE,"Earth System Science Organization (ESSO); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Unnikrishnan, C.

As the collection of such information requires field studies that are expensive, difficult, and time consuming, the prioritization of metrics can be of significant value. This study evaluates a number of metrics used to assess changes in forest structure and composition for a set of 59 forests in five countries - Kenya, India, Nepal, Uganda and USA. Changes in tree density are significantly positively correlated with changes in species richness, and changes in sapling/shrub density are significantly positively correlated with changes in species richness. Thus, rapid assessments of tree density change can be used to prioritize locations where there may be rapid deterioration in tree diversity, where the collection of detailed information on changes in species composition may be prioritized. Changes in tree density do not reflect changes in shrub and sapling density. The shrub and sapling layer appears to respond differently to human or natural disturbances compared to the tree layer, and may require separate assessment. Changes in tree DBH and tree height are not completely congruent, indicating that measurements of DBH and height may be required to accurately estimate changes in above ground carbon storage over time, for programs such as REDD that provide payment for carbon sequestration services.

Palaeoclimatic studies have indicated that the sholas have expanded in warmer climatic regimes and the grasslands during colder climates. Therefore during the present post-glacial climatic regime sholas may be in the expansion phase. Aims: We aimed to test if sholas are in an expansion phase; in particular, if smaller sholas could be at earlier successional stages than larger sholas. Methods: We enumerated all non-climbing plants (>= 1 cm dbh) in 18 shola patches ranging from 0.09 ha to 15 ha in area. We tested whether species richness, basal area, and proportion of large trees (>= 30 and >= 60 cm dbh) increased with shola size, and rare and 'ecotone' species decreased with shola size. Results: As predicted, species richness, basal area and the proportion of large trees (>= 60 cm dbh) increased with shola size, whereas the proportion of rare and 'ecotone' species decreased with shola size, and species in smaller sholas were a nested subset of those in larger sholas. Conclusions: These results suggest that shola forests are a highly structured plant community, possibly driven by succession.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2010.492843,2010,PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY,"Mohandass, D; Davidar, P",,,yield prediction; LISS-III; AWiFS; Punjab; wheat; remote sensing; yield,VEGETATION; INDEX,Punjab Agricultural University; Punjab Agricultural University; Punjab Agricultural University,"[Mukherjee, Joydeep; Gebru, Girmay; Bal, Santanu Kumar; Singh, Harpreet; Sidhu, Prabhjyot Kaur] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India; [Sood, Anil] Punjab Agr Univ, Punjab Remote Sensing Ctr, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India; [Mahey, Raj Kumar] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India","Mukherjee, J (corresponding author), Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A3226,420,3227,Factors influencing seasonal and monthly changes in the group size of chital or axis deer in southern India,"Chital or axis deer (Axis axis) form fluid groups that change in size temporally and in relation to habitat. Predictions of hypotheses relating animal density, rainfall, habitat structure, and breeding seasonality, to changes in chital group size were assessed simultaneously using multiple regression models of monthly data collected over a 2 yr period in Guindy National Park, in southern India. Over 2,700 detections of chital groups were made during four seasons in three habitats (forest, scrubland and grassland). In scrubland and grassland, chital group size was positively related to animal density, which increased with rainfall. This suggests that in these habitats, chital density increases in relation to food availability, and group sizes increase due to higher encounter rate and fusion of groups. The density of chital in forest was inversely related to rainfall, but positively to the number of fruiting tree species and availability of fallen litter, their forage in this habitat. There was little change in mean group size in the forest, although chital density more than doubled during the dry season and summer. Dispersion of food items or the closed nature of the forest may preclude formation of larger groups. At low densities, group sizes in all three habitats were similar. Group sizes increased with chital density in scrubland and grassland, but more rapidly in the latter-leading to a positive relationship between openness and mean group size at higher densities. It is not clear, however, that this relationship is solely because of the influence of habitat structure. The rutting index (monthly percentage of adult males in hard antler) was positively related to mean group size in forest and scrubland, probably reflecting the increase in group size due to solitary males joining with females during the rut. The fission-fusion system of group formation in chital is thus interactively influenced by several factors. Aspects that need further study, such as interannual variability, are highlighted.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02704733,1997,JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES,"Raman, TRS",,,,,Zoological survey of India,"INST FRANCAISE PONDICHERRY,LAB PEDOL,PONDICHERRY 605001,INDIA; ZOOL SURVEY INDIA,HIGH ALTITUDE ZOOL FIELD STN,SOLAN 173212,HIMACHAL PRADES,INDIA",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was observed that all sites lost trees due to removal by people and mortality. Loss of trees was more in sites that are easily accessible and closer to human habitation. In spite of a decrease in tree density, an increase in basal area was observed in some forest plots, which could be on account of stimulatory growth of surviving trees. Decrease in basal area in other sites indicates greater human pressure and overexploitation of trees. Preponderance of lower girth class trees, and a unimodal reverse 'J-shaped' curve of density distribution as observed in majority of the sites in the benchmark year, was indicative of regenerating status of these forests. The decrease in number of species in all forest sites was due to indiscriminate removal of trees by people, without sparing species with only a few individuals, and also due to mortality of trees of rare species. Higher species richness and diversity in the lowest dbh class in most of the sites in the benchmark year is indicative of the existence of favorable conditions for sylvigenesis. The decrease in the similarity index suggests extirpation of species, favoring invasion and colonization by secondary species.

Yamaguchi decomposition was implemented onto the dataset to express total backscatter as a sum of different scattering components from a single SAR resolution cell. Coherency matrix was used to compute complex coherence for different polarization channels. Forest areas suffered from low coherence due to volume decorrelation whereas dry river bed had shown high coherence. Appropriate perpendicular baseline and hence the interferometric vertical wavenumber was selected in forest height estimation. Coherence amplitude inversion (CAI) approach overestimated the forest height and also resulted in false heights for dry river bed. This limitation was overcome by implementing three stage inversion modeling (TSI) which assumes polarization independent volume coherence and the heights in dry river bed were completely eliminated.

These ecosystems are also reservoirs of carbon stocks, due to their ability to sequester and store carbon in their biomass and the underlying sediment, and therefore significant in view of the climate change mitigation. The present study attempted to assess the biomass and carbon stock of mangroves of Thalassery estuarine wetland of Kerala, south-west coast of India. We assessed the carbon stocks of three carbon pools viz., above-ground, below-ground (root) and sediment. A total of eight species of mangroves were recorded from the Thalassery estuarine wetland, and of these, Avicennia officinalis was the dominant species with an average tree density of 729.37 individuals ha(-1) and contributed most (45.05 +/- 23.79 t ha(-1)) to the total carbon. The overall mean above-ground biomass was 189.26 +/- 97.80 t ha(-1), while the overall mean root biomass was 83.06 +/- 40.48 t ha(-1).

In the present study, the estimates of mean combined C-stocks in mangrove and sediment showed that the mangroves of Thalassery estuarine wetland stored 153.64 t C ha(-1) which was equivalent to 563.86 t CO2 ha(-1). The mangroves of Thalassery wetland cover an area of approximately 5.8 ha and thus it can be assumed that this wetland has the potential to sequester and store 891.11 t C, equivalent to an estimated amount of 3270.37 t CO2.

,,,A1565,429,1566,Performance of PolSAR backscatter and PolInSAR coherence for scattering characterization of forest vegetation using single pass X-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data,"Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been successfully used for forest height inversion; however, there is limited applicability in spaceborne scenarios due to high temporal decorrelation. This study investigates the potential of a high-resolution fully polarimetric interferometric pair of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X SAR data with no temporal decorrelation to analyze the backscatter and coherence response and to implement polarimetric SAR interferometry-based height inversion algorithms. The data were acquired over Barkot forest region of Uttarakhand state in India. Yamaguchi decomposition was implemented onto the dataset to express total backscatter as a sum of different scattering components from a single SAR resolution cell. Coherency matrix was used to compute complex coherence for different polarization channels. Forest areas suffered from low coherence due to volume decorrelation, whereas a dry river bed had shown high coherence. The coherence amplitude inversion approach overestimated the forest height and also resulted in false heights for this dry river bed. These limitations were overcome by implementing three-stage inversion modeling, which assumes polarizationindependent volume coherence. The results were validated using ground truth data available for 49 plots, and the latter was found to be more accurate with an overall accuracy of 90.15% and root-mean-square error of 2.42 m.

Twenty-six nest-site variables were recorded in each of 27 nest plots to evaluate variability of nest-site selection. Malabar Gray Hornbills selected nest trees of significantly larger diameter at breast height (DBH 60-89 cm), and greater height of the lowest Limb than the associated values from randomly chosen trees. The number of trees of 60-74 cm DBH class was significantly higher in the nest site plots than in the random plots. Most nests were in tall live trees and were formed primarily by heart rot where a branch had broken. Comparison of relative abundance of potential nest cavities and availability of trees in different DBH classes in belt transects indicates that more cavities were formed in trees of larger diameter. Density of potential nest cavities was 10/ha. Malabar Gray Hornbills consistently chose smaller trees than sympatric Great Hornbills (Buceros bicornis).

,,,A1385,435,1386,Spatial distribution of forest biomass carbon (Above and below ground) in Indian forests,"Forest carbon (C) estimates are the key inputs to the understanding of the global C cycle. We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 51cm grid level. This study improves upon earlier spatial estimates of Indian forest biomass carbon by using data from a robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI). The realized sampling intensity has addressed the large heterogeneity of the Indian forest types and allowed the computation of 5 km grid level forest C, yielding a realistic estimate of forest biomass C in Indian forests. Forest cover density maps were intersected with 5 km mesh and estimates of forest area, forest carbon density for each Agro-ecological sub region and forest carbon pools were linked to the 5 km grid coverage of India. National forest carbon estimates for the years 1994 and 2010 are 3911.78 and 4368.03 TgC respectively, and these estimates showed a net increase of 456.25 TgC in 16 years. Uncertainty of the estimates has been addressed spatially. Mean forest carbon density increased from 61.14 Mg ha(-1) in 1994 to 64.08 Mg ha(-1) in 2010. C densities for dense and open forest in 1994 estimated as 77.08 and 38.47 Mg ha(-1) with total C pools of 2895.28 TgC and 1016.50 TgC which has increased to 80.24 Mg ha(-1) and 41.69 Mg ha(-1) with total C pools of 3176.48 TgC and 1191.55 TgC in 2010. This study provides the first 5 km level C analysis for Indian forests. Spatial distribution of C shows large differences in C density over Indian forests indicating that estimates of the spatial distribution of C are even more important than the total C pool estimates of the country.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.11.024,2018,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Rajashekar, G; Fararoda, R; Reddy, RS; Jha, CS; Ganeshaiah, KN; Singh, JS; Dadhwal, VK",,,Myxobolus; 18S rDNA; Cyprinid; Phylogeny; Myxosporeans,RANJIT SAGAR WETLAND; N.-SP MYXOZOA; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; ALGONQUIAN-PARK; INFECTING GILLS; MAJOR CARP; BIVALVULIDA; FISHES; PHYLOGENY; CNIDARIA,Panjab University,"[Gupta, Aditya] St Baba Bhag Singh Univ, Dept Zool, Jalandhar 144030, Punjab, India; [Kaur, Harpreet] Panjab Univ, Dept Zool, Chandigarh 160014, Chandigarh, India","Kaur, H (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Zool, Chandigarh 160014, Chandigarh, India.","University Grants Commission (UGC), Govt. of India under UGC-CAS-II; University Grants Commission (UGC), Govt. of India under DST-Purse [F4-28/2015/CAS-II]",,,,,,,,,,

All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height were enumerated. Dominance of a single species in the monodominant sites did not affect total tree diversity of these sites. Tree species richness totaled 56 species in four forest p and ranged from 18 (at VP site) to 27 species ha(-1) (at CK site). Tree density ranged from 771 (SP site) to 1285 trees ha(-1) (CK site).

Among the 6 forest divisions, Little Andaman recorded the highest mean biomass per unit area (1,081.26 ± 424.67 Mg ha−1) and vegetation carbon stock (494.50 ± 194.56 Mg C ha−1) followed by Middle Andaman, North Andaman, Havelock, South Andaman and Baratang. Among the 25 mangrove species, Rhizophora apiculata was found to contribute the highest biomass (152.78 Mg ha−1) and vegetation carbon stock (69.58 Mg C ha−1) followed by Bruguiera gymnorhiza, and Rhizophora mucronata. High vegetation carbon stock in mangrove forests of the Andaman Island could be attributed to high structural complexity, high precipitation rate (> 300 cm year−1), and comparatively fewer anthropogenic disturbances in the mangrove forest of the Andaman Islands. However, the Andaman Islands are increasingly vulnerable to natural calamities, like sea-level rise and associated soil erosion and increasing frequency of tropical cyclones, which call for immediate attention on preserving the island mangroves to sustain its extraordinary carbon storage capacity.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04651-5,2021,HYDROBIOLOGIA,"Ragavan, P; Kumar, S; Kathiresan, K; Mohan, PM; Jayaraj, RSC; Ravichandaran, K; Rana, TS",,,Landfill recovered waste; Refuse derived fuel; Energy recovery; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; Calorific value; Plastic waste,MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; OPEN DUMPSITE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCE; COMPLETION; GENERATION; MITIGATION; BENEFITS; DEMAND,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kharagpur; Curtin University,"[Cheela, Venkata Ravi Sankar; Dubey, Brajesh] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Cheela, Venkata Ravi Sankar; John, Michele] Curtin Univ, Sustainable Engn Grp, Perth, WA 6102, Australia","Dubey, B (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.","Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Government of India; Australian Government (CIPRS Scholarship)","gold, Green Submitted",,,,,,,,,

,,,A0305,449,306,NOVEL APPROACH FOR FOREST ALLOMETRIC EQUATION MODELLING WITH RANSAC SHAPE DETECTION USING TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNER,"Abstract. Forest biomass quantification is highly crucial for the maintenance of global carbon cycle. Hence, the accurate estimation of tree parameters is of utmost requirement nowadays. The hypothesis of this research is to formulate a volumetric equation which will be focussed on the structure of the tree and not the species. To serve this purpose, 13 plots were scanned in the Barkot forest range of Uttarakhand, India, and the plots were scanned using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The tree attribute such as radius of the stem and tree height were estimated using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm and line primitive vector, respectively. The correlation was established using multiple linear regression using the TLS derived tree parameters and field estimated tree parameters. The R2 obtained for field estimated biomass is 0.91 with radius and 0.73 with the tree height. The radius of the stem and tree height were used for the calculation of volume of all the trees and the R2 value obtained for field estimated volume and TLS derived volume is 0.95. Then the stem volume of the trees were calculated based on the new volume equation. The statistical analysis was done, and ANOVA test was performed indicating high F value (25.4) which shows that the regression model is significant. The predicted biomass correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.97) was obtained. It represents the significance of the model for the estimation of volume and biomass is high. The equation can be implemented in any forest type irrespective of the forest structure.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W4-2022-133-2022,2022,17TH 3D GEOINFO CONFERENCE,"Singh, A; Kushwaha, SKP; Nandy, S; Padalia, H",,,Dust accumulation; Stone crusher plant; Woody plants; Leaves,LEAF STRUCTURE; VEGETATION,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi,"[Rahul, Jitin] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, New Delhi 110020, India","Rahul, J (corresponding author), Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, New Delhi 110020, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, along tropical elevation gradients, frost may influence woody plant community structure by filtering out lowland tropical clades and allowing extra-tropical lineages to establish at higher elevations. Here we assess the extent to which frost and freezing temperatures influence the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of naturally patchy evergreen forests (locally known as shola ) along a mid-upper montane elevation gradient in the Western Ghats, India. Specifically, we examine the role of large-scale macroclimate and factors affecting local microclimates, including shola patch size and distance from shola edge, in driving shola metacommunity structure. We find that the shola metacommunity shows phylogenetic overdispersion with elevation, with greater representation of extra-tropical lineages above 2000 m, and marked turnover in taxonomic composition of shola woody communities near the frost-affected forest edge above 2000 m, from those below 2000 m. Both minimum winter temperature and patch size were equally important in determining metacommunity structure, with plots inside very large sholas dominated by older tropical lineages, with many endemics. Phylogenetic overdispersion in the upper montane shola metacommunity thus resulted from tropical lineages persisting in the interiors of large closed frost-free sholas, where their regeneration niche has been preserved over time.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0038,2022,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Das, AA; Ratnam, J",,,Biomass productivity; GHG emission; Microbial resilience; Earthworm diversity; Net carbon balance; Multifunctionality composite index,ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; EARTHWORM; ENERGY; CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION; CHALLENGES,Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute,"[Biswas, Benukar; Bhowmick, Udayan Rudra; Dhara, Pratap Kumar; Ghosh (Lkn), Dipak Kumar; Sarkar, Arindam; Mondal, Mousumi; Adhikary, Saju; Kanthal, Sahely] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur 741252, West Bengal, India; [Chakraborty, Debashis; Patra, Kiranmay] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Timsina, Jagadish] Global Evergreening Alliance, 1 Vis Dr,East Burwood, Melbourne, Vic 3151, Australia; [Sarkar, Sukamal] Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educ & Res Inst, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Kolkata 700103, India; [Parsad, Rajender] ICAR Indian Agr Stat Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Ray, Bikash Ranjan] Govt West Bengal, Directorate Agr, Kolkata 1, West Bengal, India; [Timsina, Jagadish] Inst Study & Dev Worldwide, 8-45 Henley Rd,Homebush West, Sydney, NSW 2140, Australia","Biswas, B (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur 741252, West Bengal, India.","Bidhan Chandra Krishi Visvavidyalaya (state agricultural university of West Bengal, India); Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Government of West Bengal; Microbiology Department of Kalyani University, Zoological Survey India",,,,,,,,,,

North-East India (NEI) region, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, covers 17.2 million ha of land under forests, constituting ~25% of India's total forest area. The population-driven abrupt decline of the fallow period's duration has aggravated soil erosion, depletion of nutrients, decreased productivity, reduced biodiversity, and weakening of essential ecosystem services. Therefore, the present research aims to explore whether the duration of the fallow period of up to 20-years can restore diversity of tree species, biomass carbon, and ecosystem carbon stock equivalent to those under natural forests. Based on the accessibility and availability of the fallow stands, three categories were selected for the study (1–2, 5–8, and 15–20 years), and these were replicated eight times for each age group. While the 20-years of fallow increased tree diversity, it was still 22% lower than that of the natural forest. Similarly, a 2.7-fold increase in biomass carbon storage was observed with an increase in the fallow period from 5–8-years (33.4 Mg ha−1) to 15–20-years (92.9 Mg ha−1), yet the latter was 40% lower than that under the natural forests. The very labile and labile carbon stocks decreased with increase in the fallow period. In contrast, the less labile and non-labile carbon stocks increased with increase in the fallow age. Because of the absence of a long fallow management system in the region, and to minimize the risks of ecosystem carbon degradation, adopting an integrated approach is recommended to enhance the ecological integrity of the degraded lands under shifting cultivation while also improving the livelihood of the shifting cultivators.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.100122,2021,ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS,"Nath, PC; Nath, AJ; Reang, D; Lal, R; Das, AK",,,Microbial indices; Soil enzymes; Microbial biomass; Forest fire; Pine forest; Oak forest,ORGANIC-MATTER; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; EXTRACTION METHOD; MEDIUM-TERM; WILDFIRE; SEVERITY; NITROGEN; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; NUTRIENTS,Doon University,"[Singh, Devanshi; Sharma, Priyanka; Kumar, Ujjwal; Daverey, Achlesh; Arunachalam, Kusum] Doon Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dehra Dun 248012, Uttarakhand, India","Kumar, U; Daverey, A; Arunachalam, K (corresponding author), Doon Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dehra Dun 248012, Uttarakhand, India.","Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC), India",gold,,,,,,,,,

Present study assesses the carbon stock of tropical dry deciduous forests varying in tree density, basal cover, and diversity located in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh in Central India. Field sampling was carried out in six forest sites viz., Chitrangi, East Sarai, Gorbi, Renukoot, West Sarai, and Waidhan, of Singrauli. A total of 29 tree species belonging to 18 families were recorded across the forest ranges where tree density, basal area and diversity values varied from 702 (Gorbhi Range) – 1671 (East Sarai range) individuals ha−1; 15.43 (Renukhund range) – 71.76 m2 ha−1 (Chitrange range) and 0.69 (West Sarai range) – 2.52 (Gorbi range), respectively. Total biomass estimated ranged from 103.32 (Renukhund range) – 453.54 Mg ha−1 (Chitrange range) while the total tree carbon density varied from 48.97 to 214.97 Mg C ha−1. The variation in carbon storage in the studied ranges was found dependent on density of trees in different diameter and age classes and tree species diversity. Diospyros melanoxylon, Butea monosperma, Shorea robusta, Senegalia catechu, Spondias pinnata, and Lagerstroemia parviflora were the dominant species at different study sites (forest ranges) and contributed towards higher carbon storage in respective forest ranges.

Principal component analysis, using the abundance of the 20 top-ranked species of each 1-ha subplot, categorized the subplots into three clusters excluding ha 4 and 5. Spearman coefficient of rank correlation analysis displayed the variation in species richness between subplots, which could partially be explained by the dominance of a few species.

The estimated area under AFS in India is 13.75 million ha with the highest concentration being in the states of Uttar Pradesh (1.86 million ha), followed by Maharashtra (1.61 million ha), Rajasthan (1.55 million ha) and Andhra Pradesh (1.17 million ha). There are many forms of agroforestry practice in India ranging from intensified simple systems of monoculture, such as block plantations and boundary planting, to far more diverse and complex systems, such as home gardens. As a result, the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of AFS are highly variable across different agro-climatic zones of India. Studies pertaining to the assessment of biomass and carbon storage in different agroforestry systems in the Indian sub-continent are scanty and most of these studies have reported region and system specific carbon stocks. However, while biomass and carbon stock data from different AFS at national scale has been scanty hitherto, such information is essential for national accounting, reporting of C sinks and sources, as well as for realizing the benefits of carbon credit to farmers engaged in tree-based production activities. Therefore, the objective of this study was to collate and synthesize the existing information on biomass carbon and SOC stocks associated with agroforestry practices across agro-climatic zones of India. The results revealed considerable variation in biomass and carbon stocks among AFS, as well as between different agro-climatic zones. Higher total biomass (>200 Mg haâˆ’1) was observed in the humid tropics of India which are prevalent in southern and northeastern regions, while lower total biomass (<50 Mg haâˆ’1) was reported from Indo-Gangetic, western and central India. Total biomass carbon varied in the range of 1.84 to 131 Mg haâˆ’1 in the agrihorticulture systems of western and central India and the coffee agroforests of southern peninsular India. Similarly, soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged between 12.26â€“170.43 Mg haâˆ’1, with the highest SOC in the coffee agroforests of southern India and the lowest in the agrisilviculture systems of western India. The AFS which recorded relatively higher SOC included plantation crop-based practices of southern, eastern and northeastern India, followed by the agrihorticulture and agrisilviculture systems of the northern Himalayas. The meta-analysis indicated that the growth and nature of different agroforestry tree species is the key factor affecting the carbon storage capacity of an agroforestry system.

,,,A0118,460,119,Foraging habitat selection of shrubland bird community in tropical dry forest,"Habitat loss due to increasing anthropogenic disturbance is the major driver for bird population declines across the globe. Within the Eastern Ghats of India, shrubland bird communities are threatened by shrinking of suitable habitats due to increased anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. The development of an effective habitat management strategy is hampered by the absence of data for this bird community. To address this knowledge gap, we examined foraging sites for 14 shrubland bird species, including three declining species, in three study areas representing the shrubland type of forest community in the Eastern Ghats. We recorded microhabitat features within an 11 m radius of observed foraging points and compared these data with similar data from random plots. We used chi-square to test the association between plant species and bird species for sites where they were observed foraging. We observed significant differences between foraging sites of all the study species and random plots, thus indicating selection for foraging habitat. Using linear discriminant analysis, we found that the microhabitat features important for the bird species were shrub density, vegetational height, vertical foliage stratification, grass height, and percent rock cover. Our results show that diet guild and foraging strata influence the foraging microhabitat selection of a species (e.g., ground-foraging species differed significantly from other species).

,,,A3184,461,3185,Sampling strategies for the assessment of tree species diversity,"This paper aims at proposing efficient vegetation sampling strategies. It describes how the estimation of species richness and diversity of moist evergreen forest is affected by (1) sampling design (simple random sampling, random cluster sampling, systematic cluster sampling, stratified cluster sampling); (2) choice of species richness estimators (number of observed species vs, non-parametric estimators) and (3) choice of diversity index (Simpson vs. Shannon). Two sites are studied: a 28-ha area situated in the Western Ghats of India and a 25-ha area located at Pasoh in Peninsular Malaysia. The results show that: (1) whatever the sampling strategy, estimates of species richness depend on sample size in these very diverse forest ecosystems which contain many rare species; (2) Simpson's diversity index reaches a stable value at low sample sizes while Shannon's index is affected more by the addition of rare species with increasing sample size; (3) cluster sampling strategies provide a good compromise between cost and statistical efficiency; (4) 300-400 sample trees grouped in small clusters (10-50 individuals) are enough to obtain unbiased and precise estimates of Simpson's index; (5) the local topography of the Western Ghats has a major influence on forest composition, the steep slopes being richer and more diverse than the ridges and gentle slopes; (6) stratified duster sampling is thus an interesting alternative to systematic cluster sampling.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.2307/3237115,1998,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Gimaret-Carpentier, C; Pelissier, R; Pascal, JP; Houllier, F",,,,SUB-TROPICAL FORESTS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; NORTHEAST INDIA; TREE; DISTURBANCE; DYNAMICS,North Eastern Hill University; North Eastern Hill University; North Eastern Hill University,"NE Hill Univ, Ctr Ecodev, Shillong 793014, Meghalaya, India; NE Hill Univ, Reg Ctr, Natl Afforestat & Ecodev Board, Shillong 793014, Meghalaya, India; NE Hill Univ, Dept Bot, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India","Tiwari, BK (corresponding author), NE Hill Univ, Ctr Ecodev, Shillong 793014, Meghalaya, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Bodamalai (BM), Chitteri (CH), Kalrayan (KA), Kolli hills (KO), Pachaimalai (PM) and Shervarayan hills (SH). The Eastern Ghats of India is relatively under-studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. The entire stretch of southern Eastern Ghats was divided into smaller grids of 6.25 km x 6.25 km, totaling to 120 grids. Within each grid, a belt transect of 0.5 ha (5 m x 1000 m) area was laid and all trees >= 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were enumerated. A total of 272 tree species (>= 30 cm gbh) that belonged to 181 genera and 62 families were recorded in the total 60 ha area inventoried. Diversity indices such as Shannon, Simpson and Fisher's alpha indices were 2.44, 0.03 and 42.1, respectively, for the whole 60 ha area. One way ANOVA revealed that the species richness varied significantly across the six sites (F-(5.823) = 4.854, p < 0.0002). Also, the contribution of tree species to total species richness classified by three plant types viz, evergreen, brevi-deciduous and deciduous species varied significantly across the sites (One way ANOVA: F-(2.15)= 10.05, p < 0.002). Similarity indices such as Jaccard and Sorensen showed that sites CH and KA are more similar in terms of species composition. The total stand density and basal area for the total 60 ha area were 27,412 stems (457 stems ha(-1)) and 1012.12 m(2) (16.9 m(2) ha(-1)), respectively. The stand density and basal area for the six sites ranged from 290 (in site BM) to 527 stems ha(-1) (in site KA) and from 5.6 (in site BM) to 24.4 m(2) ha(-1) (in site KO), respectively. Stand density and basal area of tree species varied significantly across the six hill complexes (F-(5.823) = 4.85, p < 0.0002 and F-(5.823) = 2.71, p < 0.02. respectively). A positive correlation was obtained between stand density and species richness in sites PM (r(s) = 0.65, p < 0.05) and SH (r(s) = 0.67, p < 0.05). but not in other sites. The predominant tree species in the tropical forests of southern Eastern Ghats include Albizia amara, Euphorbia antiquorum, Canthium dicoccum var. dicoccum, Memecylon edule, Chloroxylon swietenia and Nothopegia heyneana. Taxonomically. Euphorbiaceae constituted the most diverse family with 25 species. Whereas, by tree abundance the Mimosaceae with 4126 stems enumerated from the 60 ha area formed the dominant family. Bray-Curtis cluster analysis, based on tree species composition and abundance revealed that the low-diverse site BM formed a separate entity from other hill complexes. This large-scale tree diversity inventory provides a baseline data for a variety of investigations and is expected to be useful for effective forest management and biodiversity conservation of southern Eastern Ghats region.

,,,A0633,464,634,Plant biodiversity and carbon sequestration potential of the planted forest in Brahmaputra flood plains,"Globally, while experts debated whether planted forests (PF) restore biodiversity or create biological deserts, their potential role in mitigating climate change is mostly overlooked. In this study, we investigated the long-term impact of PF on the species composition, plant diversity, biomass stock, and carbon (C) storage potential in the Brahmaputra flood plain of North-East India. The phytosociological study was conducted using a modified Gentry plot method and species-specific allometric models were used to estimate biomass stock in the 39-year old PF and equivalent age of natural forest (NF). We identified 57 trees, 22 shrubs, and 23 herb species in the PF, and 54 trees, 17 shrubs, and 8 herb species in the NF. Species richness and biodiversity indices showed greater values in PF whereas species dominance and evenness were higher in NF. After 39-year of plantation, total biomass C was estimated at 165 Mg C ha−1 in PF and 197 Mg C ha−1 in equivalent age of NF. Bombax ceiba, Dalbergia sissoo, Samanea saman, Tetrameles nodiflora, and Gmelina arborea were the dominant tree species that contribute 56% of the total biomass C in the PF. The ecosystem carbon pool (plant biomass + deadwood + litter + SOC) was 17% higher in NF and showed the greater potential of carbon dioxide sequestration (959 Mg CO2 ha−1) compared to the PF (818 Mg CO2 ha−1). Our study suggested PF in flood plain degraded lands can act as a major C sink and stored a substantial amount of carbon dioxide after 39-year of the plantation. It is concluded that PF can be a preferable ecosystem management tool to fulfill the objectives of biodiversity conservation and provisioning climate services like C sequestration.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111671,2021,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Gogoi, A; Ahirwal, J; Sahoo, UK",,,Tropical forest; Selective logging; Repeat-logged forests; Deciduousness; Andaman Islands; India,SPECIES RICHNESS; REDUCED-IMPACT; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; RECOVERY; SEED; SUSTAINABILITY; REGENERATION; DISTURBANCE; RESILIENCE,Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS); Yale University,"[Surendra, Akshay; Ratnam, Jayashree] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Wildlife Biol & Conservat Program, GKVK Campus, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; [Osuri, Anand M.] Nat Conservat Fdn, 1311 Amritha,12th Main,Vijayanagar 1st Stage, Mysore 1311, Karnataka, India; [Surendra, Akshay] Yale Univ, Sch Environm, New Haven, CT 06511 USA","Surendra, A (corresponding author), Greeley Mem Lab, 370 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.","Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Govt. of India via NCBS-TIFR; Sir Dorabji Tata Trust; Lewis B.

In the present study, fourteen forest stands were selected in four different altitudes, i.e., < 1000, 1001–1400, 1401–1800, and > 1801 masl in Garhwal Himalayan of Uttarakhand, India, to assess carbon stock potential of the forest. The study was conducted during 2013–2015. Among the study sites, the maximum tree density (575 ± 90.14 ind. ha−1) was reported in New Tehri (altitude: > 1801 masl) and minimum (135 ± 5.00 ind. ha−1) in Daddi (altitude: 1001–1400 masl). The highest (96 ± 18.36 t ha−1) above-ground carbon stock was estimated in Kandikhal where bole, branch, and foliage contribute 89.93 ± 19.47, 5.17 ± 1.04 and 0.90 ± 0.14 t ha−1, respectively, while lowest (26.68 ± 9.48 t ha−1) was in Gumkhal, and contribution from the same component was found as 20.72 ± 7.84, 4.50 ± 1.58, and 1.47 ± 0.11 t ha−1, respectively. Further, highest value of below-ground carbon was in Kandikhal (28.58 ± 4.81 t ha−1) with an altitude range between 1001 and 1400 masl and the lowest in Gumkhal (9.19 ± 2.87 t ha−1) between 1401 and 1800 masl. Besides, litter production was found higher in the summer season followed by winter and rainy seasons. The study concluded that the density, height, basal area, and volume of Pinus roxburgii varied with altitude, but it was not directional. However, growth patterns and tree density were the key factors in estimating total carbon stocks and further to know the behavior of carbon dynamics (source/sink). Litter production had an inverse relation with altitude; however, increase in litter biomass at > 1801 masl was observed due to new plantations of pine.

Wood core samples were collected using the wood-cutter and incremental borer. Determination of WSG and CC was done by water displacement method and combusting in a muffle furnace. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences for both WSG and CC (P < 0.001). WSG ranges from 0.26 ± 0.01 (Jatropha curcas) to 0.81 ± 0.04 (Santalum album).

Increase in the anthropogenic pressures within the river basin and surrounding landscapes have persistently stressed the riparian ecosystem structure adversely, besides altering its composition. The objective of this study was to examine the present status of riparian vegetation along the Cauvery river basin, in response to anthropogenic pressures. For vegetation analysis, the riparian forest coming in the middle stretch of Cauvery river was categorized into two zones, viz., forest zone covering similar to 54 km stretch and agroecosystem zone covering similar to 80 km stretch. In each zone, tree species were quantified using transects at 8-km interval. Overall tree species accounting for both forest and agroecosystem were recorded and compared. The results indicate that the mean density and basal area of trees per plot were higher in the forest zone than agroecosystem zone. The Shannon-Weiner diversity of forest zone is 4.6, which is higher than agroecosystem. In addition, species composition indicated a relatively low or poor similarity between the two zones. The vegetation density and site disturbance scores for all the study sites reveals that sand mining and grazing areas have exerted negative impact on riparian forest.

This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-005-2352-5,2006,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Raman, TRS",,,KIDA; metal contamination; toxicity; risk assessment; pathway; Hyderabad; India,SOIL; LEAD,"Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT); Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Hyderabad; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI); Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI","Indian Inst Chem Technol, Analyt Chem & Environm Sci Div, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; Natl Geophys Res Inst, Geochem Div, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; Norwegian Geotech Inst, Oslo, Norway","Sekhar, KC (corresponding author), Def Res & Dev Org, Analyt Chem Grp, Def Met Res Lab, Hyderabad 500058, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

A 1-ha plot was inventoried in 1992 and was recensused in 2002. During the 10-year interval tree taxa diversity as well as stand density increased, but the basal area value decreased. Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems ha(-1) in 1992 to 1338 ha(-1) in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m(2) ha(-1)). Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10-29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend. Family-wise, tree density changes revealed that the majority of families (67%) showed an increase in stem density. Long-term studies on tree population changes are essential to estimate tree mortality and recruitment rates, which will provide a greater insight in tropical forest dynamics.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-9649-7,2005,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Venkateswaran, R; Parthasarathy, N",,,biodiversity value; conservation status; Manipur; sacred grove; socio-cultural aspects; tree diversity,MEGHALAYA; DIVERSITY,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology (NERIST); North Eastern Hill University,"N Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India; NE Hill Univ, Dept Bot, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India","Khumbongmayum, AD (corresponding author), N Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A0762,474,763,"Assessing Restoration Potential of Fragmented and Degraded Fagaceae Forests in Meghalaya, North-East India","The montane subtropical broad-leaved humid forests of Meghalaya (Northeast India) are highly diverse and situated at the transition zone between the Eastern Himalayas and Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspots. In this study, we have used inventory data from seedlings to canopy level to assess the impact of both biotic and abiotic disturbances on structure, composition, and regeneration potential of the Fagaceae trees of these forests. Fagaceae trees are considered as the keystone species in these forests due to their regional dominance and their importance as a fuel wood source, and also because they form an important component of climax community in these forests. Unfortunately, these forests are highly degraded and fragmented due to anthropogenic disturbances. We have assessed, for the first time, the restoration potential (i.e., capacity to naturally regenerate and sustain desired forest structure) of Fagaceae species in the genera Lithocarpus Blume, Castanopsis (D. Don) Spach, and Quercus Linn. We also evaluated how biotic and abiotic factors, as well as anthropogenic disturbances, influence the restoration potential of these species in six fragmented forest patches located along an elevational gradient on south-facing slopes in the Khasi Hills, Meghalaya. Fagaceae was the most dominant family at all sites except one site (Laitkynsew), where it was co-dominant with Lauraceae. Fagaceae forests have shown high diversity and community assemblages. Fagaceae species had high levels of natural regeneration (i.e., seedlings and saplings) but low recruitment to large trees (diameter at breast height or DBH â‰¥ 10 cm) at all sites. The ability to sprout was higher in Fagaceae tree species than non-Fagaceae tree species. We have shown that human disturbance and structural diversity were positively related to regeneration of Fagaceae tree species due to high sprouting. However, with increasing human disturbance, recruitment of saplings and pole-sized trees to mature trees hampered the resulting proportion of mature Fagaceae tree species. This study provides a means for assessing regeneration and a basis for forest management strategies in degraded and fragmented forests of Meghalaya.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3390/f11091008,2020,FORESTS,"Singh, PP; Chakraborty, T; Dermann, A; Dermann, F; Adhikari, D; Gurung, PB; Barik, SK; Bauhus, J; Fassnacht, FE; Dey, DC; Rosch, C; Saha, S",,,Tree carbon stock; Soil carbon stock; REDD+ strategy; AGB; BGB; Ecology; Agricultural science; Environmental science; Earth sciences,ABOVEGROUND TREE BIOMASS; SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; LAND-USE CHANGE; REMOTE-SENSING DATA; TROPICAL FORESTS; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; URBAN; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; STORAGE,Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Rain Forest Research Institute (RFRI),"[Bhattacharya, A.; Saikia, K.; Sarkar, P.] Univ Sci & Technol, Baridua 9th Mile, Meghalaya, India; [Takhelmayum, M.] Rain Forest Res Inst, Jorhat, Assam, India","Sarkar, P (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol, Baridua 9th Mile, Meghalaya, India.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

We identified and analyzed various aspects of forest community composition with the effect of climatic variables and altitudes in the Singalila National Park (SNP), Khangchendzonga Landscape in Eastern Himalayas (India). We encountered 2075 woody individuals of 70 species within a transect (2000 m-3636 m asl). The entire forest regime reflected a dominance of young trees and the species richness showed a negative correlation with the altitude. Climatic variables (actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration and moisture index) are the measures of available environmental energies which drive the final shape of forest community structure. Our study revealed that these forces showed a significant relationship with species richness and altitude of the forest which provides the present shape of forest community composition structure of the SNP.

Impact of NTFP extraction on regeneration, population structure, and species composition","Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sires, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber Sorest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however; may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02907329,1996,ECONOMIC BOTANY,"Murali, KS; Shankar, U; Shaanker, RU; Ganeshaiah, KN; Bawa, KS",,,Ficus; India; strangler; epiphyte,FICUS-PERTUSA; RAIN-FOREST; HABITS,University of Miami,"UNIV MIAMI,DEPT BIOL,CORAL GABLES,FL 33124",,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been few comprehensive assessments of recovery following restoration in fragmented forest landscapes, and the efficacy of active versus passive (i.e., natural regeneration) restoration remains unclear. We examined 11 indicators of forest structure, tree diversity and composition (adult and sapling), and aboveground carbon storage in 25 pairs of actively restored (AR; 7-15 yr after weed removal and mixed-native tree species planting) and naturally regenerating (NR) plots within degraded rainforest fragments, and in 17 less-disturbed benchmark (BM) rainforest plots in the Western Ghats, India. We assessed the effects of active restoration on the 11 indicators and tested the hypothesis that the effects of active restoration increase with isolation from contiguous and relatively intact rainforests. Active restoration significantly increased canopy cover, adult tree and sapling density, adult and sapling species density (overall and late-successional), compositional similarity to benchmarks, and aboveground carbon storage, which recovered 14-82% toward BM targets relative to NR baselines. By contrast, tree height-diameter ratios and the proportion of native saplings did not recover consistently in actively restored forests. The effects of active restoration on canopy cover, species density (adult), late-successional species density (adult and sapling), and species composition, but not carbon storage, increased with isolation across the fragmented landscape. Our findings show that active restoration can promote recovery of forest structure, composition, and carbon storage within 7-15 yr of restoration in degraded tropical rainforest fragments, although the benefits of active over passive restoration across fragmented landscapes would depend on indicator type and may increase with site isolation. These findings on early stages of recovery suggest that active restoration in ubiquitous fragmented landscapes of the tropics could complement passive restoration of degraded forests in less fragmented landscapes, and protection of intact forests, as a key strategy for conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2860,2019,ECOSPHERE,"Osuri, AM; Kasinathan, S; Siddhartha, MK; Mudappa, D; Raman, TRS",,,Mangifera indica; genic simple sequences repeat; genetic diversity; principal coordinate analysis; AMOVA,SOFTWARE,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Research Centre on Seed Spices; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute For Plant Biotechnology (NIPB),"[Lai, S.; Singh, A.

Sampling plots of 10 x 100 m (1000 m(2), 0.1 ha) were surveyed in ten different locations within a large patch, giving a total sample area of approximately 1 ha. All individual stems (>= 1 cm dbh) of trees, shrubs and lianas from these plots were identified to species level and counted. A total of 3896 individuals (>= 10 cm dbh) comprising 97 species, 79 genera and 45 families were included. On average there were a total of 1246 individual stems of at least 10 cm per hectare with a basal area 53.33 m(2) ha(-1). The species abundance distribution did not differ significantly from a log-normal distribution. According to the Importance value index (IVI), five species, namely Litsea glabrata, Lasianthus venulosus, Meliosma simplicifolia, Daphniphyllum neilgherrense and Neolitsea fischeri were dominant species in the community and influenced forest structure more than any other species present. Lauraceae, Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae and Symplocaceae were most dominant families according to the Family Importance Value index (FIV). Our results also suggest that disturbance influences tree species richness and density and liana density and basal area, in addition to forest structure and changes species composition.

The preparation of training data sets used thematic maps of the area, and knowledge accruing from extensive personal field visits. Sample field plots were located at 30 different places in the Sanctuary for classification accuracy assessment. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was also computed from LISS-III satellite imagery. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the Sanctuary was generated using a GIS. The DEM was used to test the hypothesis that its joint use with the satellite data would increase classification accuracy. This proved to be the case. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed between spectral and DEM variables to cross-check the results.

The results suggest that mangroves of the ANI consist of 38 mangrove species belonging to 12 families and 19 genera, which includes 4 hybrids and 34 species. In other words, about 50% of the global mangrove species are present in ANI. Andaman Islands have 35 species and Nicobar Islands have 21 mangrove species. The average tree density in ANI is 1746/per hectare and varies from 487 to 2383 per hectare. The Shannon diversity index for the whole ANI is 2.94 and Simpson index is 0.07. Family Rhizophoraceae constitutes an important vegetative component in the mangroves of the ANI followed by Acanthaceae, Lythraceae and Malvaceae. Rhizophora spp. constitutes 19% of the Important Value Index (IVI) and R. apiculata is dominant in ANI. Among the eight forest divisions, mangrove diversity is high in South Andaman (30 species) followed by Middle Andaman (28), Mayabunder (25), Diglipur (25), Nicobar (21), Little Andaman (20), Havelock (20) and Baratang (20). The average mangrove plant density and Shannon diversity index (H') is high in Middle Andaman (2101/hectare; H' = 2.93). Species richness index (d') is high in South Andaman (3.32). Evenness index (J') is high in Little Andaman (0.92). Simpson dominance index (D) ranged between 0.07-0.1, and this agrees with the high diversity in mangroves of ANI. In all the divisions Rhizophora spp. constitutes a major vegetative component except, Diglipur and Nicobar. In Diglipur Bruguiera spp. are dominant, while in Nicobar Sonneratia spp. are dominant. The low similarity value of the Nicobar division with other divisions indicates the difference in floristic structure of mangroves of the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands.

,,,A2364,489,2365,India's biodiversity hotspot under anthropogenic pressure: A case study of Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve,"This paper presents data on the impact of biotic pressure in terms of grazing by livestock and wood cutting by humans on the plant community in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve of India. Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human-elephant conflict.

The present paper synthesizes the first report related to the documentation and conservation of ethnomedicinal plants of Chandauli district and their socio-economic relationship with the forests and its resources. Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical data were collected using semi-structured interviews, field observations, preference and direct matrix ranking with traditional medicine practitioners. Results: The use of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 27 families was documented in the tribal communities of Chandauli district in India. These species were used in combination of some exotic species such as Foeniculum vulgare. Prosopis spicigera, Crataeva nurvala, Curcuma longa, Punica granatum, Aloe vera, Cocos nucifera, Ocimum sanctum and Allium cepa and some medicinal stones, minerals, salts. etc. Most of the plants (94.6%) were reportedly used to treat human diseases. Conclusions: Documenting the eroding plants and associated indigenous knowledge can be used as a basis for developing management plans for conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants in the area. The principal threatening factors reported were deforestation (90%). agricultural expansion (85%) and overgrazing (53%). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ground data on phyto-sociology and Leaf Area Index (LAI) over the study area was collected in 23 sampling points (20m x 20m) over the study area. Phyto-sociological data collected over the study area was used to compute plot-wise biometric parameters like basal area, volume, stem density and dominant height. ENVISAT ASAR data covering the study area, pertaining to 24 November 2005, has been geo-referenced and digital number (DN) values were converted to radar backscatter values. Regression analysis between backscatter and the retrieved biometric variables has been done to explain the relationships between SAR backscatter and forest parameters. Analysis showed a significant correlation between backscatter and biometric parameters and backscatter values typically increased with increase in basal area, volume, stem density and dominant height. The scatter observed between ASAR backscatter and stem density, basal area and dominant height suggested limitation of C-band data in estimating biometric variables in heterogeneous forest systems. Further, ASAR data was used in conjunction with Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6)-Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS) III data of 16 October 2004 to classify the study area into different land use/land cover (LU/LC) classes. Various texture and adaptive filters were applied on ASAR image to reduce speckle noise and enhance image features. An attempt is made to merge ASAR image with LISS-III to enhance feature discrimination. Training sets corresponding to the ground data have been used to derive confusion matrices for the ASAR and LISS-III images. Results suggested better discrimination of vegetation types in the merged data suggesting the possible use of ASAR data in forest type discrimination.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160701253295,2007,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,"Chand, TRK; Badarinath, KVS",,,,PLANTS,University of Queensland; University of Queensland; BSES Limited,"Univ Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Sugar Ind Innovat Biotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; BSES Ltd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia","Brumbley, SM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Sugar Ind Innovat Biotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,

Presently, some of these long-term observational studies are functional, some are disturbed and others have almost been lost. The accumulated data will become increasingly important in the context of environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50-ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS-SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP). Arguments are presented in favour of enumeration and analysis methods which are consistent with current approaches in forest ecological research. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the moist deciduous forest very fine root biomass was significantly higher under the open canopies (309 g m(-2)) than in the closed canopies (222 g m(-2)). While in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forest ecosystems closed canopies (Site II: 318, Site III: 315 and Site IV: 275 g m(-2)) were comparatively higher in very fine root biomass than the open canopies (264, 278 and 239 g m-2). A similar trend was observed in the fine root productivity also. Under the closed canopies, total fine root standing crop biomass was significantly higher under the evergreen forest (1847-2021 g m(-2)) compared with others (1081 g m(-2) and 1298 g m(-2)). Root production and standing crop biomass showed a seasonal pattern of maximum during the rainy season and minimum in the dry season. Necromass fraction ranged between 52-132 g m(-2) and the maximum was in the dry period. Localized disturbances such as canopy openings contributed towards the reduction of fine root biomass. Due to the annual wild fire and the consequent grass community dominance in the moist deciduous forest (Site I), greater standing crop of very fine root biomass and net primary productivity was observed. Further, the study revealed that the fine root biomass and production increased significantly due to litter accumulation (P < 0.05) and the soil moisture (P < 0.01) at the ground level. The above results are discussed in the light of understanding the fragility of tropical forests and their management.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03785-1,1996,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Sundarapandian, SM; Swamy, PS",,,arid held conditions; VAMP; Vigna aconitifolia; Cenchrus ciliaris; Prosopis juliflora,RHIZOSPHERE MICROORGANISMS; MICRONUTRIENT UPTAKE; WHITE CLOVER; PHOSPHORUS; MAIZE; ROOT; HYPHAE; COPPER; WATER; WHEAT,,,"Tarafdar, JC (corresponding author), CENT ARID ZONE RES INST, JODHPUR 342003, RAJASTHAN, INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,

Maximum fine and coarse root mass of P. kesiya, and fine root and rhizome mass of the ground vegetation were recorded during the rainy season. The contribution of the tree fine roots in 0-10 cm soil layer declined from 51% in the 6-year old stand to about 33% in the older stands. The major proportion (63-88%) of herbaceous fine root and rhizome mass was concentrated in this soil layer in all the three stands. The majority (36-57%) of tree coarse roots were present in the 10-20 cm layer in all the stands. The biomass and necromass values in the case of fine roots were more or less equal in a given stand, but the coarse roots had 5 to 9 times more live than the dead mass. The proportion of herbaceous fine root mass to the total fine root mass declined from 54% in the 6-year old stand to 30-32% in the 15- and 23-year old stands. The mean total fine root mass (pine + herbaceous species) decreased from 417 g m(-2) in the 6-year old stand to 302 in 15-year and 322 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand. Annual fine root production showed a marked decrease from 1055 g m(-2) in the 6-year old stand to 743 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand, but coarse root production increased from 169 g m(-2) in the 6-year to 466 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand; the total root production thus remained approximately constant.

,,,A2291,499,2292,"Rodent seed predation: effects on seed survival, recruitment, abundance, and dispersion of bird-dispersed tropical trees","Tropical tree species vary widely in their pattern of spatial dispersion. We focus on how seed predation may modify seed deposition patterns and affect the abundance and dispersion of adult trees in a tropical forest in India. Using plots across a range of seed densities, we examined whether seed predation levels by terrestrial rodents varied across six large-seeded, bird-dispersed tree species. Since inter-specific variation in density-dependent seed mortality may have downstream effects on recruitment and adult tree stages, we determined recruitment patterns close to and away from parent trees, along with adult tree abundance and dispersion patterns. Four species (Canarium resiniferum, Dysoxylum binectariferum, Horsfieldia kingii, and Prunus ceylanica) showed high predation levels (78.5-98.7%) and increased mortality with increasing seed density, while two species, Chisocheton cumingianus and Polyalthia simiarum, showed significantly lower seed predation levels and weak density-dependent mortality. The latter two species also had the highest recruitment near parent trees, with most abundant and aggregated adults. The four species that had high seed mortality had low recruitment under parent trees, were rare, and had more spaced adult tree dispersion. Biotic dispersal may be vital for species that suffer density-dependent mortality factors under parent trees. In tropical forests where large vertebrate seed dispersers but not seed predators are hunted, differences in seed vulnerability to rodent seed predation and density-dependent mortality can affect forest structure and composition.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2252-9,2012,OECOLOGIA,"Velho, N; Isvaran, K; Datta, A",,,Phenology; MTCI; MERIS; Fourier; Double logistic; Asymmetric Gaussian; Whittaker smoother; Filter techniques,CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOURIER-ANALYSIS; PLANT PHENOLOGY; HIGH-LATITUDES; MODIS; INDIA; COVER; MERIS; VARIABILITY; COMPOSITE,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; University of Southampton; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","[Jeganathan, C.] BIT, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India; [Atkinson, Peter M.; Dash, Jadu] Univ Southampton, Global Environm Change & Earth Observat Res Grp, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Atzberger, Clement] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Surveying Remote Sensing & Land Informat, Vienna, Austria","Jeganathan, C (corresponding author), BIT, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A3210,501,3211,"Conservation status of forests and wildlife in the Eastern Ghats, India","The Eastern Ghats (EGs) comprise a chain of ancient low hills in the state of Andhra Pradesh adjoining the east coast of India. These hill ranges are well known for a rich array of tropical forests with great conservation significance which support large human populations. A series of protected areas (PAs) have been established by the government along these ranges to conserve the regional biodiversity, but their effectiveness is often questionable. In order to assess the ecological status of the forests both within and outside the PAs and to assess the impacts of ongoing forestry practices a survey was conducted along the EGs. Plant species richness, and density of shrubs and trees, were estimated along disturbance gradients (core, buffer and fringe situations) using random plots of 10-m radius for trees, and 5-m radius (nested) plots for shrubs and saplings. Indirect evidence (spoor) of domestic and wild animals was recorded within the sample plots to compare habitat use by the animals. Srivenkateshwara National Park in the Seshachalam Hills, Gundlabrahmeshwaram Sanctuary in Nallamalais and some parts of Srisailam-Nagarjunasagar Tiger Reserve, had the least degraded forests due to their PA status. However, collection of non-timber forest products, bamboo harvesting and livestock grazing continues in all areas irrespective of legal status. All bamboo areas have been heavily worked. It is recommended that bamboo working should be stopped in core areas of the PAs and reduced from nine to six months (October to March) in the buffer zones. Summer is a period of potential water shortage for wild animals and bamboo workers' camps near water courses may affect habitat use by these species. The proposed Gudem Maripakhala Sanctuary, well known for its biogeographical value and diverse nora, is seriously threatened as a result of to extensive 'podu' (slash and burn) cultivation. It is suggested that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation and better agricultural practices, should be adopted in this area.

The present study aimed to assess the community attributes, viz., structure, composition and diversity in the moist and dry sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the West Bengal province of India and compare them with the other sal forests of India. The phytosociological data from these forests were quantitatively analysed to work out the species richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, importance value, stand density and the basal area. The analysis showed that plant richness and diversity in moist sal forests of northern West Bengal are higher than the dry sal forests of south-west Bengal; a total of 134 tree (cbh a parts per thousand yen30 cm), 113 shrub and 230 herb species were recorded in the moist sal forest compared to 35 tree, 41 shrub and 96 herb species in dry sal forest. Papilionaceae was observed to be the dominant family. Dry sal forests had higher tree dominance (0.81) and stand density (1,006 stems ha(-1)) but lower basal area (19.62 m(2)ha(-1)) while moist sal forest had lower tree dominance (0.18) and stand density (438 stems ha(-1)) but higher basal area (56.52 m(2)ha(-1)). Tree species richness and stem density across girth classes in both the types decreased from the smallest to largest trees, while the occurrence rate of species increased with increase in girth class.

The wildlife sanctuary is entirely managed by the Forest Department, whereas the sacred forest is jointly managed by the local community and the Forest Department. Our results showed that the sacred forest had a greater species richness, density and diversity compared to the wildlife sanctuary. The density in different diameter classes showed that the sacred forest is regenerating with a good regeneration potential, but the wildlife sanctuary had a poor regeneration potential with lower numbers of saplings than adults. However, the biomass and carbon content of the wildlife sanctuary were higher than in the sacred forest. This may be due to the presence of a higher proportion of old trees in the wildlife sanctuary compared to the sacred forest. Biomass values can be used to emphasize the role of management in maintaining the carbon stock in forest ecosystems. Our results can be helpful in framing conservation strategies and action plans for forest patches in India and globally.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2019.1586118,2019,ECOSCIENCE,"Pradhan, A; Ormsby, AA; Behera, N",,,,,Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham; Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham Coimbatore,"[Kumar, S.

The role of mangrove forests in mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation is well recognized. The present field study aimed to estimate the carbon stocks of Mahanadi Mangrove Wetland (MMW), east coast of India. Carbon stocks were estimated in vegetation and soil of natural mangrove forest stands and new mangrove plantation stands. The mean of carbon stock in natural stands was 143.4 +/- 8.2 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.1 +/- 8.9 and soil 54.3 +/- 3.0 Mg C ha(-1)) and plantation at 151.5 +/- 7.9 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 90.6 +/- 16.2 and soil 60.9 +/- 5.6 Mg C ha(-1)). The mean overall C-stock of natural stands and plantations was 147.0 +/- 8.1 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.4 +/- 7.6 and soil 57.6 +/- 3.2 Mg C ha(-1)), which is 1.6 times higher than that in forests of Odisha. A positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in the surface soil (0-30 cm), indicating the role of vegetation in building surface soil/sediment organic carbon. The 6651 ha of mangrove forests in the MMW is estimated to store 0.98 Mt of C, which is equivalent to 3.59 Mt of CO(2)e. The present study reveals that MMW stores substantial amount of atmospheric carbon and therefore needs to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as increase carbon storage. Further, mangrove plantations, on a per unit area basis, can sequester as much carbon as natural stands.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.18520/cs/v110/i12/2253-2260,2016,CURRENT SCIENCE,"Sahu, SC; Kumar, M; Ravindranath, NH",,,,OECOPHYLLA-SMARAGDINA; PLANT MUTUALISM; HYMENOPTERA; COMPETITION,Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR); National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS),"[Devarajan, Kadambari] Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Wildlife Conservat Soc India Program, Post Grad Programme Wildlife Biol & Conservat, Bengaluru, India","Devarajan, K (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Wildlife Conservat Soc India Program, Post Grad Programme Wildlife Biol & Conservat, Bengaluru, India.",National Centre for Biological Sciences,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

Purulia is a part of the biogeographic zone Deccan Peninsula Chhotonagpur. The authors have reported the use of medicinal plants by nine tribes of the district against various gastrointestinal disorders. Materials and methods: Semi structured questionnaire was used during the interview with the informants having traditional botanical knowledge. Bhumijs, Birhor, Gond, Ho, Kharia, Mal Pahariya, Mundas, Oraon and Santhali represent the various aboriginal groups present in the district. The use of medicinal plants were documented using an interview data sheet mentioning the names, age, profession and gender of the informants and scientific and vernacular names, families, part(s) used, disease(s) treated, method of preparation, mode of administration of the botanicals and the preparations. Results: A total number of 56 plants belonging to 29 families have been reported to be used against different types of gastrointestinal disorders viz, indigestion, stomach pain, vomiting tendency, constipation, piles, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, loss of appetite, liver complaints, intestinal worms etc. Fabaceae and Apocynaceae were found to be the dominant families of medicinal plants used to treat such ailments. Conclusion: Age, gender, literacy and profession of the aboriginals were found to be the significant factors when the traditional knowledge of medicinal botanicals was concerned. Due to urbanization and loss of biodiversity, the authors have noted a significant decrease in the ethnic knowledge as well as the botanicals. Preservation of folklore should be given utmost importance in this region to prevent the rapid loss of ethnobotanical wealth. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A part of the Timli Forest Range of Kalsi Soil and Water Conservation Division, Uttarakhand, India was selected for the present study. Stratified random sampling was used to collect biophysical data from 36 sample plots of 0.1 ha (31.62 mx31.62 m) size.

A study was conducted to measure carbon stocks in various land-use systems including forms and reliably estimates the impact of land use on carbon (C) stocks in the forest of Rajasthan, western India (23 degrees 3'-30 degrees 12'N longitude and 69 degrees 30'-78 degrees 17'E). 22.8% of India is forested and 0.04% is the deforestation rate of India. In Indian forest sector of western India of Aravally mountain range covered large area of deciduous forest and it's very helpful in carbon sequestration at global level. The carbon stocks of forest, plantation (reforestation) and agricultural land in aboveground, soil organic and fine root within forest were estimated through field data collection. Results revealed that the amount of total carbon stock of forests (533.64 +/- 37.54 Mg.ha(-1), simplified expression of Mg (carbon) .ha(-1)) was significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (324.37 +/- 15.0 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (120.50 +/- 2.17 Mg.ha(-1)). Soil organic carbon in the forests (172.84 +/- 3.78 Mg.ha(-1)) was also significantly greater (P<0.05) than the plantation (153.20 +/- 7.48 Mg.ha(-1)) and the agricultural land (108.71 +/- 1.68 Mg.ha(-1)). The differences in carbon stocks across land-use types are the primary consequence of variations in the vegetation biomass and the soil organic matter. Fine root carbon was a small fraction of carbon stocks in all land-use types. Most of the soil organic carbon and fine root carbon content was found in the upper 30-cm layer and decreased with soil depth. The aboveground carbon (ABGC): soil organic carbon (SOC): fine root carbon ratios (FRC), was 8:4:1, 4:5:1, and 3:37:1 for the forest, plantation and agricultural land, respectively.

,,,A2572,512,2573,"Relationship between annual rainfall and tree mortality in a tropical dry forest: Results of a 19-year study at Mudumalai, southern India","Variability in rainfall is known to be a major influence on the dynamics of tropical forests, especially rates and patterns of tree mortality. In tropical dry forests a number of contributing factors to tree mortality, including dry season fire and herbivory by large herbivorous mammals, could be related to rainfall patterns, while loss of water potential in trees during the dry season or a wet season drought could also result in enhanced rates of death. While tree mortality as influenced by severe drought has been examined in tropical wet forests there is insufficient understanding of this process in tropical dry forests. We examined these causal factors in relation to inter-annual differences in rainfall in causing tree mortality within a 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot located in the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mudumalai, southern India, that has been monitored annually since 1988. Over a 19-year period (1988-2007) mean annual mortality rate of all stems >1 cm dbh was 6.9 +/- 4.6% (range = 1.5-17.5%); mortality rates broadly declined from the smaller to the larger size classes with the rates in stems >30 cm dbh being among the lowest recorded in tropical forest globally. Fire was the main agent of mortality in stems 1-5 cm dbh, elephant-herbivory in stems 5-10 cm dbh, and other natural causes in stems > 10 cm dbh. Elephant-related mortality did not show any relationship to rainfall. On the other hand, fire-related mortality was significantly negatively correlated to quantity of rainfall during the preceding year. Mortality due to other causes in the larger stem sizes was significantly negatively correlated to rainfall with a 2-3-year lag, suggesting that water deficit from mild or prolonged drought enhanced the risk of death but only with a time lag that was greater than similar lags in tree mortality observed in other forest types. In this respect, tropical dry forests growing in regions of high rainfall variability may have evolved greater resistance to rainfall deficit as compared to tropical moist or temperate forests but are still vulnerable to drought-related mortality.

Soppinabetta forests are farmer-managed, fragmented evergreen forests of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. We hypothesized that these forests have immense importance in conservation of epiphytic orchid flora, although management intensity may differentially affect the diversity. Orchid diversity of the Soppinabetta forests of two degrees of management (sustained Soppinabetta, N = 11; degraded Soppinabetta, N = 4) has been compared with protected reserve forest fragments (N = 6). A total of 3537 orchid individuals of 41 species were recorded from 1.05 ha area; 39 species were found in the Soppinabetta forests. Orchid species richness was highest in sustained Soppinabetta forests (26.2) compared to degraded Soppinabetta (23) and reserve forest fragments (20.5). Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that the orchid community of the degraded Soppinabetta was distinct. It was found that even when the total alpha diversity was preserved, a shift in the orchid species can take place with anthropogenic disturbance. About 21% of the overall surveyed trees were phorophytes. Mean phorophytes ranged between 15% and 46.5% among three forest types. Compositional variation of phorophyte trees had little effect on orchid diversity of the fragments. The present study shows that the deficiency of properly protected reserve forests can be compensated by the farmer-managed local Soppinabetta forests for epiphytic orchid conservation in the region.

An estimation of vegetational structure and biomass would be helpful for evaluating both productivity and sustainability of the forest ecosystems. Information regarding vegetational biomass, litter mass and fine root biomass, and overall dry matter dynamics are very limited. Therefore, the present work deals the vegetation biomass influenced by four different site quality of Sal dominating tropical deciduous forest of Chhattisgarh, India. The current study provides a framework under which all vegetational attributes can be quantified under varying site quality which is modified by different seasons. Our study revealed a significant increase in vegetational attributes and biomass as per increasing quality of sites. The density value (individuals/ha) and basal area (m2/ha) of tree, sapling and seedling in different sites were ranged from 710 to 1010, 2000 to 2500, 9750 to 14,500 and 33.5 to 46.8, 0.32 to 0.33, 17.96 to 21.43, respectively. The total biomass varied from 187.39 to 383.46 t ha−1. The fine root and forest floor biomass varied between 2.44 and 4.20 t ha−1, and 2.32 and 2.83 t ha−1, respectively among different sites and seasons. The total litter fall varied from 4.18 to 5.69 t ha−1 yr−1 across the site quality. It reflected that highest value of forest floor, litter floor and fine root biomass were seen in site quality (SQ) SQ-I followed by SQ-II, SQ-III and SQ-IV, respectively in different seasons. A great synergy exists among site quality, stand structure and biomass which surely affect ecosystem structure and its functions. Seasonal impacts are another factor that regulates vegetational statistics, forest floor, fine roots and pattern of litterfall in varying site qualities.

Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4 km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815 ha(-1)) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stems ha(-1)) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3 m(2) ha(-1) as compared with the site mean of 35 m(2) ha(-1)) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50 % of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 ha and 1-ha scales.

The Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot, lacks spatially explicit representation of plant richness patterns and predictor environmental covariates. The rugged Himalayan terrain limits large-scale field surveys, we, therefore, disentangle the role of remotely sensed environmental proxies for characterization of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and prediction of plant richness in an alpine area in WesternHimalaya. Alpine plant richness was recorded in cluster plots (10 random quadrants of 1m(2) in approximately 1-ha area) across 97 sites in Pithoragarh district in part of the Western Himalaya(India). The dominant PFTs were mapped based on support vector machine classification of Landsat 8 image. Thesatellite-derived climate, landscape,and topographic variables were correlated to plant richness using generalized linear model (GLM) with poisson distribution to unravel species richness-environment linkages in the study area. The dominant PFTs mapped were herbaceous meadow, Danthonia grassland, Kobresia sedge meadow, moist scrub, and dry scrub. The GLM based plant richness model explained 70% variation in alpine plant richness. The environmental factorssuch as vegetation vigor, elevation, landscape diversity and moisturewere observed to influence alpine plant richness of the study area.

According to UNFCCC, REDD is a multilevel activity that involves both national policy and structures, as well as subnational projects involving local communities [1]. While many Asian nations are trying to create frameworks that link the national strategy to sub-national projects, in India this formal integration has yet to take place. As a consequence projects like the Khasi Hills Community REDD+ project fall outside the UNFCCC strategy and operate under voluntary standards (Plan Vivo) and markets. The project involves both avoided deforestation and reforestation components. The project is being implemented by a federation of ten Khasi tribal kingdoms, a major ethnolinguistic group in the Indian state of Meghalaya. Project experience may provide guidance regarding actions required to create a more enabling environment for community forest carbon projects in Asia. These findings may better inform the December 2015 21st UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Paris as they again address REDD strategy. The experience of this Khasi Federation [2] in designing and implementing a REDD project has led to the emergence of a modernizing forest management system that is helping to conserve and restore the Khasi's ancestral forests. Learning from this REDD project also illustrates the barriers that the Khasi communities have faced, including those imposed by national governments, certifiers, and carbon markets, that will likely constrain the expansion and replication of community-based climate initiatives. The author suggests some alternative policies and systems that may enable greater community participation in REDD projects.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3390/f6124382,2015,FORESTS,"Poffenberger, M",,,Hydrochemistry; Rain shadow rivers; Weathering; Downstream hydrochemical trend; Southern Western Ghats,MAJOR ION CHEMISTRY; SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY; WEATHERING PROCESSES; ELEMENT CHEMISTRY; CO2 CONSUMPTION; SMALL CATCHMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; GEOCHEMISTRY; AMAZON; BASIN,University of Kerala,"[Thomas, Jobin; Joseph, Sabu] Univ Kerala, Dept Environm Sci, Thiruvananthapuram 695581, Kerala, India; [Thrivikramji, K.

Population structure of I. griffithii Hook. f. Thorns. was studied by observing number of individuals of the species during 2003-2004 in three stands experiencing different degrees of disturbance in temperate broad-leaved forest of Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India. Individuals were categorized based on diameter classes, i.e. seedlings (0-2 cm), saplings (> 2-6 cm) and trees (> 6 cm). The stand density of trees (> 6 cm diameter ranges from 564 ha(-1) in disturbed stand to 904 ha in undisturbed stand while basal area was recorded highest in undisturbed stand, (12.55 m(2) ha(-1)) and lowest in highly disturbed stand (6.04 m(2) ha(-1)). The density-diameter class distribution (individuals per hectare) follows the trend: seedlings < saplings < trees in all the three stands. This clearly indicates that the regeneration status of I. griffithii is poor. The diameter distribution pattern indicates decreasing number of individuals in higher diameter classes. This may be due to the harvesting of higher girth individuals for firewood and other purposes by local people. The overall population structure of I. griffithii reveals the dominance of adult individuals in the three stands, which emphasized the negative role of disturbance adversely impacting the regeneration of L griffithii. On the other hand, due to free access, there is unchecked exploitation. Anyone can extract as much as (s)he can. Therefore, a policy should be made to protect the species legally.

To achieve this, an integration of Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite datasets could provide an accurate estimation of forest biomass. This will also help in removing the uncertainties associated with the single sensor-based estimation approaches. Therefore, the present study attempts to integrate Sentinel-2 optical data with Sentinel-1 SAR dataset to estimate AGB in the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), Gujarat, India. In this study, two non-parametric machine learning algorithms viz Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with different kernel functions—linear, sigmoidal, radial and polynomial and Random Forest (RF) were employed for the prediction of AGB using different combinations of VV, VH, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Incidence Angle (IA). Ground based AGB was estimated through allometric equation at 35 sampling sites with the help of tree height and Diameter at Breast’s Height (DBH). Standalone collinearity analysis among different parameters resulted in poor correlation of AGB with VH (r = 0.05) and IA (r = 0.015), whereas a significantly good correlation with NDVI (r = 0.80) and VV (r = 0.74) were observed. Inclusion of NDVI with VV and VH together also resulted in a better correlation (r = 0.85) than other combinations. The SVM with linear kernel utilizing parametric the combinations of VV + VH + NDVI and VV + VH + NDVI + IA were found to be best performing on the basis of evaluation metrics. The outcome of this study highlighted the significance of machine learning techniques and synergistic use of different remote sensing data for an improved AGB quantification in tropical forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2021.03.035,2022,ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH,"Malhi, RKM; Anand, A; Srivastava, PK; Chaudhary, SK; Pandey, MK; Behera, MD; Kumar, A; Singh, P; Kiran, GS",,,L band; ALOS-2 SAR; Lithological discrimination; GLCM; Naga fold-thrust belt; Fracture geometry,SAR DATA; TEXTURE; IMAGE; REGION,"Jadavpur University; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Space Applications Centre (SAC)","[Ghosh, Tanaya; Hazra, Sugata] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata 700032, India; [Das, Anup Kumar] Space Applicat Ctr ISRO, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India","Ghosh, T (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata 700032, India.","SAC-ISRO, Government of India; School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University, India",,,,,,,,,,

The present study is an attempt to describe and quantify the upper-storey vegetation of a forest at Terai Duars in West Bengal state, India. Stratified random nested quadrat sampling was adopted to mark 57 quadrats of size 20 x 20 m to describe the quantitative characters of upper-storey vegetation composition in the forest using number of individuals, occurrence of a species in quadrats, diameter, status of distribution and Importance Value Index (IVI). Upperstorey vegetation comprised 131 tree species, represented by 43 families and 92 genera. On the basis of total number of individuals recorded from all the quadrats, species were categorized as few, medium and high. The distribution status of species was described as frequent, rare and abundant in occurrence. The abundant species can be regarded as the prominent upper-storey species in the forest. This type of species occurrence is expected in typical species-rich tropical forests that reflect heterogeneity or distribution of dominance across the species. The tree species found in the forest were also described as very low diversity, low diversity, diverse and highly diverse, to indicate an overall picture of a species and their importance in the plant community. On the basis of diameter, the species were grouped as small, intermediate and large. This indicates that neither younger trees nor mature trees dominated in the forest. The quantitative characters described in this study could well act as indicators of change and susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors among various vegetation categories and their formation which could be further interpreted as a distinct wildlife habitat.",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),2017,"PLANT BIODIVERSITY: MONITORING, ASSESSMENT AND CONSERVATION","Shukla, G; Pala, NA; Gantait, S; Chakravarty, S",,,,DRY EVERGREEN FORESTS; TREE SPECIES-DIVERSITY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; FLORISTIC COMPOSITION; PLANT BIODIVERSITY; DECIDUOUS FOREST; EASTERN GHATS; WESTERN-GHATS; VEGETATION DYNAMICS,Shiv Nadar University,"[Sharma, Jyoti K.] Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Dadri, Gautam Budh Nag, India","Sharma, JK (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Sch Nat Sci, Environm Sci & Nat Resource Management, Dadri, Gautam Budh Nag, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to understand the functional diversity of tree reproductive traits of sacred forest patches in an altered landscape. Twenty-five sacred groves in Palakkad region, Kerala, India, were chosen to assess the distribution of five reproductive traits - pollination mechanism, fruit size, seed number, seed size and dispersal mechanism - among the tree populations. The data matrix was analysed for overall trait-state distribution, functional diversity assessment and its relation to environmental parameters and disturbance in the area. A total of 87 woody species was documented with a fairly homogenized distribution of fruit and seed characters, with >= 50% of the recorded trait states in each grove in comparison to control plot. Pollination and dispersal mechanisms are dominated by a single guild. e.g. insects and birds, often generalist in nature. Functional richness had a strong correlation with Shannon's index and disturbance, but evenness and divergence were weakly related with others. Comparative assessment with null model showed no significant deviations from expected results indicating apparent lack of habitat filtering or resource competition among sacred groves. The trait homogenization and overall simplification of the grove biota is perhaps an outcome of rapid land-use change and its consequences on specialist members. This study shows sacred groves are important for maintaining a plethora of functional traits in the altered landscape. However, the prevalence of generalist mediators indicates maintenance of basic ecological functions in the landscape without support for specialist ones.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467417000360,2017,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Ray, R; Sreevidya, EA; Ramachandra, TV",,,Coal mining; Ecological restoration; Geotechnical properties; Land use; Overburden dump; Reclamation success,RECLAIMED MINE SOIL; RESTORATION; LAND,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines) Dhanbad,"[Karan, Shivesh Kishore; Kumar, Adarsh; Samadder, Sukha Ranjan] Indian Sch Mines, Indian Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhanbad, Bihar, India","Samadder, SR (corresponding author), Indian Sch Mines, Indian Inst Technol, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhanbad, Bihar, India.","Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, India",,,,,,,,,,

and its corresponding biomass loss. Hence, quantification of various forest parameters such as biomass is imperative for evaluating
the carbon. The objective of this research was to exploit the potential of C-band Radarsat-2 Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) technique for analysing the relationship between complex coherence and field-estimated aboveground
biomass. Association between the backscatter and the aboveground biomass was also established in the process. To serve our
objective, Radarsat-2 interferometric pair dated 4thMarch, 2013(master image) and 28th March, 2013 (slave image) were procured for
the Barkot Reserve Forest region of Dehradun, India. Field sampling was done for 30 plots (31.62m x 31.62m) and stem diameter
and tree height were measured in each plot. The study emphasized on the application of POLINSAR coherence instead of using
conventional method of relying on backscatter values for retrieving forest biomass. Coherence matrices were utilized for generating

,,,A1642,534,1643,Does structural connectivity influence tree species distributions and abundance in a naturally discontinuous tropical forest formation?,"AimsThe study of naturally discontinuous forest systems could help further our understanding of the relative roles of abiotic factors and spatial connectivity in influencing species turnover and plant metacommunity structure, compared to continuous forest formations, where local communities are often arbitrarily defined and where mass effects' and source-sink dynamics tend to confound the roles of dispersal and environment. Here we studied a tropical montane landscape where old-growth evergreen forest occurs as patchy formations in a matrix of natural grasslands, to test the influence of environment and connectivity on species turnover and woody plant metacommunity structure. LocationWestern and southern regions of the Upper Nilgiri Plateau, Western Ghats, southern India. MethodsWe sampled 85 vegetation plots located across a 600-km(2) landscape, assembled environmental data, constructed contrasting spatial connectivity models, including models for the effects of topography on structural connectivity, and used RDA-based variation partitioning to assess the relative influence of environment and space on woody plant metacommunity structure. ResultsConsidering several environmental and multi-scale spatial predictors, we could explain half of the variation in plant community structure. Environmental and habitat factors such as precipitation, temperature seasonality, elevation, fragment size and landscape context play a dominant role, explaining approximately 40% of variation. Spatial predictors based on Euclidean distance performed better than those that accounted for topographic resistance. Spatial predictors accounted for only 9% of the variation in plant metacommunity structure. ConclusionOur results support the species sorting paradigm of metacommunity structure, as abiotic effects and biotic interactions play dominant roles in influencing community structure and species turnover in these old-growth forests, with a comparatively small influence of spatial connectivity. Effective management of woody species diversity would therefore require conservation of these forests across the range of environmental conditions under which they occur.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12474,2017,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Das, AA; John, R; Anand, M",,,RISAT-1; Hybrid polarimetry; Classification; Support vector machine,BIOMASS; CLASSIFICATION; BACKSCATTER; RECOGNITION,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)","[Padalia, Hitendra; Yadav, Sadhana] ISRO, Forestry & Ecol Dept, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India","Padalia, H (corresponding author), ISRO, Forestry & Ecol Dept, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,C0180,535,3355,How do habitat filtering and niche conservatism affect community composition at different taxonomic resolutions?,"Understanding how local species assembly depends on the regional biogeographic and environmental context is a challenging task in community ecology. In spatially implicit neutral models, a single immigration parameter, I(k), represents the flux of immigrants from a regional pool that compete with local offspring for establishment in communities. This flux counterbalances the effect of local stochastic extinctions to maintain local species diversity. If some species within the regional pool are not adapted to the local environment (habitat filtering), the migrant flux is reduced beyond that of the neutral model, such that habitat filtering influences the value of I(k) in non-neutral situations. Here, we propose a novel model in which immigrants from the regional pool are filtered according to their habitat preferences and the local environment, while taxa potentially retain habitat preferences from their ancestors (niche conservatism). Using both analytical reasoning and simulations, we demonstrate that I(k) is expected to be constant when estimated based on the community composition at several taxonomic levels, not only under neutral assumptions, but also when habitat filtering occurs, unless there is substantial niche conservatism. In the latter case, I(k) is expected to decrease when estimated based on the composition at species to genus and family levels, thus allowing a signature of niche conservatism to be detected by simply comparing I(k) estimates across taxonomic levels. We applied this approach to three rain forest data sets from South India and Central America and found no significant signature of niche conservatism when I(k) was compared across taxonomic levels, except at the family level in South India. We further observed more limited immigration in South Indian forests, supporting the hypothesis of a greater impact of habitat filtering and heterogeneity there than in Central America. Our results highlight the relevance of studying variations of I(k) in space and across taxonomic levels to test hypotheses about the ecological and evolutionary drivers of biodiversity patterns.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/13-0064.1,2014,NA,"F Munoz, BR Ramesh, P Couteron",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, forest/non-forest classification and estimation of forest above ground biomass over tropical regions are very important and relevant in understanding the contribution of tropical forests in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in terms of carbon pools and fluxes. Information on the spatio-temporal biomass distribution acts as a key input to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) action plans. This necessitates precise and reliable methods to estimate forest biomass and to reduce uncertainties in existing biomass quantification scenarios. The use of backscatter information from a host of all-weather capable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems during the recent past has demonstrated the potential of SAR data in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/nonforest classification. In the present study, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data along with field inventory data have been used in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/non-forest classification over Odisha state, India. The ALOS-PALSAR 50m spatial resolution orthorectified and radiometrically corrected HH/HV dual polarization data (digital numbers) for the year 2010 were converted to backscattering coefficient images (Schimada et al., 2009). The tree level measurements collected during field inventory (2009-'10) on Girth at Breast Height (GBH at 1.3m above ground) and height of all individual trees at plot (plot size 0.1ha) level were converted to biomass density using species specific allometric equations and wood densities. The field inventory based biomass estimations were empirically integrated with ALOS-PALSAR backscatter coefficients to derive spatial forest above ground biomass estimates for the study area. Further, The Support Vector Machines (SVM) based Radial Basis Function classification technique was employed to carry out binary (forest-non forest) classification using ALOS-PALSAR HH and HV backscatter coefficient images and field inventory data. The textural Haralick's Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures are determined on HV backscatter image for Odisha, for the year 2010. PALSAR HH, HV backscatter coefficient images, their difference (HH-HV) and HV backscatter coefficient based eight textural parameters (Mean, Variance, Dissimilarity, Contrast, Angular second moment, Homogeneity, Correlation and Contrast) are used as input parameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM) tool. Ground based inputs for forest/non-forest were taken from field inventory data and high resolution Google maps. Results suggested significant relationship between HV backscatter coefficient and field based biomass (R-2 = 0.508, p = 0.55) compared to HH with biomass values ranging from 5 to 365 t/ha. The spatial variability of biomass with reference to different forest types is in good agreement. The forest/non-forest classified map suggested a total forest cover of 50214 km(2) with an overall accuracy of 92.54%. The forest/non-forest information derived from the present study showed a good spatial agreement with the standard forest cover map of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and corresponding published area of 50575 km(2).

,,,A1063,541,1064,"Forest biomass estimation using remote sensing and field inventory: a case study of Tripura, India","Forests are the potential source for managing carbon sequestration, regulating climate variations and balancing universal carbon equilibrium between sources and sinks. Further, assessment of biomass, carbon stock, and its spatial distribution is prerequisite for monitoring the health of forest ecosystem. Moreover, vegetation field inventories are valuable source of data for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB), density, and the carbon stored in biomass of forest vegetation. In view of the importance of biomass, the present study makes an attempt to estimate temporal AGB of Tripura State, India, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and the field inventory data through geospatial techniques. A model was developed for establishing the relationship between biomass, LAI, and NDVI in the selected study site. The study also aimed to improve method for quantifying and verifying inventory-based biomass stock estimation. The results demonstrate the correlation value obtained between LAI and NDVI were 0.87 and 0.53 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The correlation value between estimated AGB with LAI were found as 0.66 and 0.69, while with NDVI, the values were obtained as 0.64 and 0.94 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The regression model of measured biomass with MODIS NDVI and LAI was developed for the data obtained during the period 2011-2014. The developed model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of biomass and its relationship between LAI and NDVI. The R-2 values obtained were 0.832 for estimated and the measured AGB during the training and 0.826 for the validation. The results indicate that the methodology adopted in this study can help in selecting best fit model for analyzing relationship between AGB and NDVI/LAI and for estimating biomass using allometric equation at various spatial scales. The developed output thematic map showed an average biomass distribution of 32-94 Mg ha(-1).

Quantifying this change may lead to a better understanding of the ecology and the effective management of invasive species. We used data on density of the highly invasive shrub Lantana camara (lantana) for the period 1990-2008 from a 50 ha permanent plot in a seasonally dry tropical forest of Mudumalai in southern India. We used a cumulative link mixed-effects regression approach to model the transition of lantana from one qualitative density state to another as a function of biotic factors such as indicators of competition from local species (lantana itself, perennial grasses, invasive Chromolaena odorata, the native shrub Helicteres isora and basal area of native trees) and abiotic factors such as fire frequency, inter-annual variability of rainfall and relative soil moisture. The density of lantana increased substantially during the study period. Lantana density was negatively associated with the density of H. isora, positively associated with basal area of native trees, but not affected by the presence of grasses or other invasive species. In the absence of fire, lantana density increased with increasing rainfall. When fires occurred, transitions to higher densities occurred at low rainfall values. In drier regions, lantana changed from low to high density as rainfall increased while in wetter regions of the plot, lantana persisted in the dense category irrespective of rainfall. Lantana seems to effectively utilize resources distributed in space and time to its advantage, thus outcompeting local species and maintaining a population that is not yet self-limiting.

The plant communities of the three selected stands (S1, S2, and S3) of this forest were categorized into three vegetation strata: overstory trees, understory trees and shrubs, and a ground layer with scattered herbs and tree seedlings. The three stands contained 44, 19, and 8 species in each stratum, respectively, and three climber species. Importance value index (IVI) and basal area/cover did not show a clear dominance for particular species, and this is identified as a mixed forest with deciduous as well as evergreen species. Therefore, dominant species in each layer were categorized according to an IVI value of 10 and greater than 10% relative basal area. Within each stratum, species richness and plant population density decreased with an increase in plant size. Both species diversity and productivity were relatively high compared to the reference site because of protection from biotic disturbances, which cannot be controlled on the reference site. Creation of new forest on the barren land has contributed significant soil amelioration in the degraded sodic soil of the Indogangetic plains. The soil properties of the three stands did not vary much, although different tree species dominated the stands. Maximum soil amelioration was recorded for total N, followed by mineralized N, available N, and organic carbon contents for the nutritional properties. With regard to chemical properties, exchangeable sodium was greatly reduced in comparison to other properties viz pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable Ca content. During 40 years of growth and development of the diverse vegetation in the revegetated forest, microbial C increased to about five times that of the surrounding barren sodic soils. There were no significant changes in soil structure even though the water-holding capacity of the soil improved to about 53% of the once barren land due to a 7-fold increase in organic carbon content.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00005.x,2005,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Tripathi, KP; Singh, B",,,conservation; human disturbance; monodominance; permanent plot; sacred groves; tree diversity; tropical dry evergreen forest,SCALE PERMANENT PLOT; RAIN-FOREST; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT BIODIVERSITY; DECIDUOUS FOREST; WESTERN-GHATS; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; MONODOMINANCE; FLORISTICS,Pondicherry University,"Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India","Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

They affect not only the species diversity of native areas but also their biological integrity. In India, a number of invasive exotic weeds have been reported but some viz. Parthenium hysterophorus, Lantana camara and Ageratum conyzoides, especially those from tropical America are troublesome and have caused adverse ecological, economic and social impact. These weeds can be seen growing in different landscapes but are luxuriantly localized in unattended forests and cultivated areas. Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae, commonly known as congress grass) is perhaps the most troublesome and noxious weed of urban and rural India. Besides rapidly colonizing areas replacing the native vegetation, it is also known to cause a number of human health problems such as skin allergy, rhinitis and irritation to eyes of the residents in the vicinity. Likewise, it causes fodder scarcity in addition to being unpalatable and toxic to livestock. Lantana camara (Verbenaceae), another serious tropical American pest, has encroached upon large areas of land, especially the forests where it has virtually replaced the forest floor vegetation and reduced tree growth. Also because of its bushy and spreading type of growth it obstructs forest operations. The third weed, Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae, Billy goat weed) has invaded agricultural fields. It interferes with crops and causes yield reductions of major staple crops of India. When it invades rangeland areas, it out competes native grasses causing scarcity of fodder. These weeds have similar growth strategies such as fast growth rates, short life-cycles, greater reproductive potential, high competitive abilities and allelopathy that make them successful invaders of native habitats. Mechanical, chemical, biological and cultural control tactics have failed individually, though integrated approaches combining all these approaches along with community participation and proper land management have been relatively successful.

We determined the relative influence of these two mechanisms by examining variation in flocks across nine rain-forest fragments (range 11-2600 ha) in a plantation landscape in the Western Ghats, India. We found differences between fragments in average number of species (range 10.8-15.2) and individuals (range 19.0-37.6) per flock, number of species that participated in flocks (range 34-59), encounter rates (range 0.5-2.4 flocks h(-1)) and flock composition. Multiple regression and randomization tests revealed that different mechanisms contributed to this variation. Three flock variables (openforest individuals per flock, total open-forest species that participated in flocks in a fragment, flock composition) mainly reflected changes in the bird communities of fragments. Habitat structure strongly influenced three flock variables (open-forest species per flock, total and rain-forest individuals per flock) and flock composition to a lesser extent. Finally, flock encounter rate was strongly related to fragment area, but not to abundance of flock participants indicating habitat degradation-induced changes in propensities of species to flock.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467408004823,2008,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Sridhar, H; Sankar, K",,,groundwater; aravalli quartzite; lineaments; buried pediment plains; NDVI,GIS,"Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Applicat Remote Sensing Lab, New Delhi 110067, India","Mukherjee, S (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Applicat Remote Sensing Lab, New Mehrauli Rd, New Delhi 110067, India.",,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,,,,,,,
,,,A2850,553,2851,"Tree density, basal area and species diversity in a disturbed dry tropical forest of northern India: implications for conservation","Dry tropical forest communities are among the world's most threatened systems and urgent measures are required to protect and restore them in degraded landscapes. For planning conservation strategies, there is a need to determine the few essential measurable properties, such as number of species and basal area, that best describe the dry forest vegetation and its environment, and to document quantitative relationships among them. This paper examines the relationships between forest basal area and diversity components (number of species and evenness) for a disturbed dry tropical forest of northern India. Data were collected from five sites located in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India, selected on the basis of satellite images and field observations to represent the entire range of conditions in terms of canopy cover and disturbance regimes. These sites represented different communities in terms of species composition. The forest was poorer in species richness, and lower in stem density and basal area than wet forests of the tropics. Across sites (communities), the diversity components and tree density were positively related with total tree basal area. Considering basal area as a surrogate of biomass and net production, diversity is found to be positively associated with productivity. A positive relationship between basal area, tree density and species diversity may be an important characteristic of the dry forest, where recurring disturbance does not permit concentration of biomass or stems in only a few strong competitors. However, the relationships of basal area with density, alpha diversity and evenness remain statistically significant only when data from all sites, including the extremely disturbed one, are used in the analysis. In some sites there was a greater coefficient of variation (CV) of basal area than in others, attributed to patchy distribution of stems and resultant blanks. Therefore, to enhance the tree diversity of these forests, the variability in tree basal area must be reduced by regulating local disturbances. Conservation activities, particularly fuelwood plantations near human settlements, deferred grazing and canopy enrichment through multi-species plantations of nursery-raised or wild-collected seedlings of desirable species within the forest patches of low basal area, will be needed to attain restoration goals, but reforestation programmes will have to be made attractive to the forest-dwelling communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892906003237,2006,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Sagar, R; Singh, JS",,,FIA; subtropical dry forest; biomass; stem volume; Puerto Rico; Caribbean; additive models,TROPICAL FORESTS; INVENTORY; BRAZIL; TREE,United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA; Delaney Forestry Serv LLC, Albany, OR 97321 USA; USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Brandeis, TJ (corresponding author), USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, 4700 Old Kingston Pike, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,

The study area had five prevailing land uses viz., agriculture, agro-horticulture, horticulture, silvi-pasture, and forest at four elevations representing about 1 A degrees C temperature change. The results showed that maximum total biomass of 404.35 Mg C ha(-1) was accumulated by forest landuse and followed a decreasing trend in the order as forest > silvi-pasture > agro-horticulture > horticulture > agriculture. Similar trends were also seen with respect to biomass carbon (C) density and C-sequestration potential of different land uses. Biomass and carbon density potential enhanced with the increase in the altitudinal ranges from 1100-1400 to 2000-2300 m a.s.l. But, the rate of C-sequestration potential enhanced from 1100 to 2000 m and declined at 2000-2300 m a.s.l. Maximum carbon density (393.29 Mg C ha(-1)) of both plant as well as soil was displayed by the forest-based land use systems situated at an altitudinal gradient of 2000-2300 m a.s.l. The rate of C-sequestration was maximum (2.17 Mg ha(-1)) in the agro-horticulture at 2000-2300 m a.s.l.

,,,A0697,556,698,Edge effects alter the role of fungi and insects in mediating functional composition and diversity of seedling recruits in a fragmented tropical forest,"Abstract Background and Aims In fragmented forests, proximity to forest edges can favour the establishment of resource-acquisitive species over more resource-conservative species. During seedling recruitment, resource-acquisitive species may benefit from either higher light availability or weaker top-down effects of natural enemies. The relative importance of light and enemies for recruitment has seldom been examined with respect to edge effects. Methods In a human-modified wet tropical forest in India, we first examined how functional traits indicative of resource-acquisitive vs. resource-conservative strategies, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content, wood density and seed size, explained interspecific differences in densities of seedling recruits with distance to the forest edge. Then, we checked whether fungicide and insecticide treatments and canopy openness (proxy for light availability) explained edge effects on trait-mediated changes in seedling density. Finally, we examined whether light availability and natural enemy activity explained edge effects on functional diversity of seedling recruits. Key Results Up to 60 m from edges, recruit densities increased with decreasing seed size, but not at 90â€“100 m, where recruit densities increased with higher SLA. Trait-mediated variation in recruit densities changed with pesticides only at 90â€“100 m: compared with control plots, fungicide increased recruit densities for low SLA species and insecticide increased smaller seeded species. For SLA, wood density and seed size, functional diversity of recruits was higher at 90â€“100 m than at 0â€“5 m. At 90â€“100 m, fungicide decreased functional diversity for SLA and insecticide reduced seed size diversity compared with control plots. Canopy openness explained neither variation in recruit density in relation to traits nor functional diversity. Conclusions Altered biotic interactions can mediate local changes to trait composition and functional diversity during seedling recruitment in forest fragments, hinting at downstream effects on the structure and function of human-modified forests.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcaa138,2020,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Krishnadas, M; Agarwal, K; Comita, LS",,,Canonical correspondence analysis; Environmental variables; Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve; Species richness; Western Himalaya,GLOBALLY CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ELEVATION GRADIENT; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; FOREST COMMUNITIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; KUMAUN HIMALAYA; TAXON RICHNESS; DISTURBANCE; CARBON,,"[Rawat, Balwant; Negi, Arvind Singh] Graph Era Hill Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India","Rawat, B (corresponding author), Graph Era Hill Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India.","SERB, Govt. of India [TAR/2018/001033]",,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, anthropogenic alteration of natural landscapes leading to land use and land cover change, habitat loss, and species extinctions (may) have putatively disturbed this relationship. Hence, it is important to study the nature of the relationship in such human influenced landscapes. Methods: In this study, we endeavored to understand the consistency of the relationship in the fragmented natural landscapes in the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia hills of Meghalaya in northeast India, with Adinandra griffithii (an endangered endemic tree) as a model species. We reconstructed the distribution of its suitable habitats as a function of the remotely sensed vegetation phenology (i.e., EVI data), using point occurrence data and ecological niche modeling (ENM) tool. Estimation of the abundance and habitat characterization was done through field surveys following standard methods. Results: The study revealed that remotely sensed landscape-level vegetation phenology could effectively discriminate the suitable and unsuitable habitats of threatened species. Linear regression model showed a weak positive correlation between abundance and predicted habitat suitability for adult trees indicating (plausible) deterioration in the relationship. However, sapling and seedling populations did not show a precise trend in this respect. Field-based studies revealed that removal of the species from the suitable habitats because of anthropogenic disturbances possibly weakened the abundance-suitability relationship. Conclusions: The findings of the study enjoin the need for re-establishment of the species in the suitable areas for its conservation and perpetuation.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-018-0114-z,2018,ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Adhikari, D; Mir, AH; Upadhaya, K; Iralu, V; Roy, DK",,,Passive buildings; Field data; Decision trees; Comfort; Data representation,LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; DECISION TREE; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION; OPERATION,Polytechnic University of Milan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; CEPT University,"[Geronazzo, Angela] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Informat Elettron & Bioingn, Milan, Italy; [Brager, Gail] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Manu, Sanyogita] CEPT Univ, Ctr Adv Res Bldg Sci & Energy, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India","Geronazzo, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Informat Elettron & Bioingn, Milan, Italy.","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (GOI) under the U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research (PACE-R) program's U.S.-India Joint Center for Building Energy Research and Development (CBERD) project; U.S. DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]",,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1985,558,1986,Restoration of rain forest beneath pine plantations: A relay floristic model with special application to tropical South Asia,"In the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP's comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.

Euphorbiaceae, with 8 species, was the most speciose family followed by Lauraceae, Meliaceae and Leguminosae. Dispersion of species was either clumped or random, and only two species were uniform. Rare species (less than or equal to 1 stem ha(-1)) constituted 36% of the flora and were randomly distributed. Tree species dominated the flora with 87.3% share. Mixed dominance of species groups prevailed in the forest, i.e. large, medium and small trees and shrubs shared stand density in nearly equal proportions, but climbers were less abundant. Among five most abundant species, none was a large tree. However, four of the five species accumulating maximum basal area were large trees. All the girth classes showed a multi-species dominance, with 21 species in mature ( greater than or equal to 180 cm girth), 40 in elder (greater than or equal to 90 to < 180 cm), 55 in young ( greater than or equal to 30 to < 90 cm), and 68 in juvenile class ( greater than or equal to 10 to < 30 cm). Six species were available only in seedling layer (greater than or equal to 30 cm height to < 10 cin girth). Thus of all 93 species, 20.4% showed good regeneration, 10.8% fair, 30.1% poor and 17.2% lacked regeneration. The remaining 21.5% species seem to be reappearing. While high-grade timber species were poorly regenerating, shrubs and climbers were regenerating well.

A total of one hundred 10 m x 10 m (total 1 ha) plots were laid to reveal tree diversity and richness of UGSs. Trees with >= 10 cm girths at breast height (gbh) were inventoried. We recorded 45 species in 42 genera and 21 families. Caesalpiniaceae and Fabaceae each with 6 species dominated the study area followed by Arecaceae (3). Density and stand basal area of the present study were 500 stems ha(-1) and 64.16 m(2), respectively. Most of the inventoried trees were native (31 species) and deciduous (28 species). Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae dominated the present study area in terms of stand basal area and density. The Shannon diversity index and evenness of study area were 2.79 and 0.73, respectively. The most important species and families based on species important value index (IVI) and family important value index were Albizia saman, Polyalthia longifolia and Azadirachta indica; Fabaceae, Caesalpiniaceae and Annonaceae respectively.

about 39.5% and 60% of total 38 species exhibited local demographic instability at different levels of
lantana cover for the first and the second census respectively. This decline in species could be attributed
to altered microenvironment (light, pH and temperature) beneath the lantana bushes. The study concludes
that the presence of lantana shrub as dense understorey perturbs the seedling recruitment of native tree

In the ecologically rich region of India’s Western Ghats, specifically, farm-scale tree species diversity is a key structural condition explaining avian diversity. Surveying a sample of coffee plantations in the region, we examine farm-scale conditions that give rise to biodiversity. Results suggest that larger plantation size, recent increase in canopy density, and the cultivation of Coffea arabica varieties all encourage tree species diversity necessary for habitat. Results also suggest, however, that these structural conditions are more labor and pesticide intensive. These findings raise some serious questions about the sustainability of biodiversity in this context and suggest difficult trade-offs under conditions of demographic transition, declining labor availability, and concern about chemical inputs.

The population structure of the forest was determined through density of seedlings, saplings and trees from the sampling quadrat. Based on individual density of seedling, sapling and adult, the regeneration potential of the species was determined. A total of 58 tree species under 50 genera belonging to 30 families were recorded in the forest. The overall density ranged from 1525 to 6600 ind/ha and the total basal area ranged from 0.577 to 46.81 m2/ha in case of trees and saplings, whereas for seedlings, the value ranged from 511.96 to 1221 cm2/ha. The good regeneration pattern of tree species varied from 12.12% to 31.575%, fair regeneration pattern from 12.12% to 31.57%, new regeneration from 5.26% to 39.13%, poor regeneration from 0% to 10.52%, and no regeneration of trees from 15.78% to 42.42%. Inadequate regeneration status and population structure of tree species like Shorea robusta, Careya arborea, Ficus auriculata were observed which could be due to looping, scraping, grazing and trampling.

The minor forests that are subjected to intense human pressures had a negative growth rate, i.e. 0.237 t/ha/year, while the reserve forests have a carbon assimilation rate of 1.31 t/ha/year. This indicates that human pressure has certainly decreased the carbon accumulation in the forests of Uttara Kannada.

Such habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to species with specialized habitat and foraging requirements and their ability to persist in such landscapes may depend on their adaptability to habitat modification. Great Hombills Buceros bicornis, among the largest birds in Asian tropical rainforests, depend on large trees for nesting and a diverse array of patchily distributed fruiting trees. In the human-modified landscape of the Anamalai Hills, India, we compared the breeding biology and nesting behaviour of Great Hombills in contiguous rainforest (N=3 nests) and in modified habitat consisting of coffee plantations and rainforest fragments (N=5 nests). The nesting cycle of seven of the eight nests monitored varied between 114 and 130 days. Nest provisioning behaviour was similar in contiguous forest and modified habitat in terms of visitation and food delivery rates, but visitation tended to be higher and food delivery rate lower during the nestling phase than during incubation. As expected, tree density and native food plant diversity were lower in modified habitat than in continuous forest. The diversity of food provisioned was lower in modified habitat with a 57.5% dietary overlap with contiguous forest.

To this end, a massive vegetation data set, consisting of 51,834 4-variate observations has been clustered into different landscapes by Nagendra and Gadgil [Current Sci. 75 (1998) 264-271]. But a study of such importance may be affected by nonuniqueness of cluster analysis and the lack of methods for quantifying uncertainty of the clusterings obtained. Motivated by this applied problem of much scientific importance, we propose a new methodology for obtaining the global, as well as the local modes of the posterior distribution of clustering, along with the desired credible and highest posterior density regions in a nonparametric Bayesian framework. To meet the need of an appropriate metric for computing the distance between any two clusterings, we adopt and provide a much simpler, but accurate modification of the metric proposed in [In Felicitation Volume in Honour of Prof. B. K. Kale (2009) MacMillan]. A very fast and efficient Bayesian methodology, based on [Sankhya Ser. B 70 (2008) 133-155], has been utilized to solve the computational problems associated with the massive data and to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of clustering on which our proposed methods of summarization are illustrated. Clustering of the Western Ghats data using our methods yielded landscape types different from those obtained previously, and provided interesting insights concerning the differences between the results obtained by Nagendra and Gadgil [Current Sci. 75 (1998) 264-271] and us.

The role of abiotic ecological determinants on structuring the vegetation has been
well studied. The present study evaluated the independent and integrated strength of
the abiotic and biotic determinants in explaining species richness of woody plants in
the Indian Himalayan forest. The primary field inventory data was collected using
nested quadrat method (tree species at 10 × 10 m2, shrub species at 5 × 5 m2, and
herb species at 1 × 1 m2 quadrats) for different life forms and for the abundance
estimation within each 1 km transect. Each transect was laid in a 6.3 × 6.3 km2 grid
on the study site. The biotic determinants included diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)
and tree height, whereas the abiotic determinants were temperature, precipitation,
soil moisture, relative humidity and elevation. A total of 302 woody plant species
(233 genera and 53 families) were recorded from the field inventory. The woody
plant species richness was found to range from 1 to 54 per ha at transect level.
Structural Equation Model (SEM) evaluated different combinations of ecological
determinants for woody plant species richness. The abiotic or biotic determinants
were non-significant if considered independently; however, the integration of both
resulted in a significant relation with woody plant species richness. The best combination of ecological determinants include density d.b.h. ≥ 2.5 cm, tree height, relative
humidity, and elevation (R2 = 0.53). Overall, the integration of biotic and abiotic
determinants better explained woody plant species richness in the Indian Himalayan

In view of the importance of biomass estimates in the global carbon (C) cycle, the present study demonstrates the potential of the standwise tree outside forest inventory data and finer spatial resolution of IRS-P6 LISS-IV satellite data to classify TOF, to estimate above-ground TOF phytomass and the carbon content of TOF in a semi-arid region of the southern Haryana, India. The study reports that above-ground TOF phytomass varied from 1.26 tons/ha in the scattered trees in the rural/urban area to 91.5 tons/ha in the dense linear TOF along the canal. The total above-ground TOF phytomass and carbon content was calculated as 367.04 and 174.34 tons/ha, respectively in the study area. The study results conclude that the classification of TOF and estimation of phytomass and carbon content in TOF can be successfully achieved through the combined approach of Remote Sensing and GIS based spatial technique with the supplement of field data.

Detailed tree measurements and location mapping are performed in 13 (1 ha) plots and 1 a very large permanent plot of 32 ha and AGB is estimated using local volume equations. Remote sensing-based AGB estimated using a multiple linear regression model between the reflectance (Sentinel-2) and backscatter (Sentinel-1) with field AGB. The result shows relative root mean square error of the model decreased by approximately 50% with a plot size increase from 0.01 ha (64%) to 0.64 ha (14%).

In this study, the relationship between Lantana camara invasion and native forest understorey vegetation was described after accounting for environmental influences. Rainfall, terrain slope, altitude and fire frequency were measured from GIS layers, and tree density, dry above-ground L. camara biomass, and native plant abundance and species richness were measured in nested plots (four 1 x 1-m plots for grass, tree seedlings and L. camara within one 5-m-radius plot for tree saplings and herbs and shrubs within one 10-m-radius plot for trees) at 80 locations distributed across Bandipur Tiger Reserve, a tropical deciduous forest in southern India. Relationships between environmental factors and L. camara abundance were described using a multiple regression. Further, the role of L. camara abundance in explaining residual variation in native vegetation, after accounting for environmental influences, was described using linear models. Lantana camara abundance decreased with increasing tree density, supporting the notion that it thrives in disturbed forest with fewer trees. Whereas native tree seedling and herb and shrub density showed no relationship to L. camara abundance, both tree sapling density and grass volume decreased under L. camara biomass exceeding 2 kg m(-2). These data suggest that, by association with grass decline and decreased recruitment of tree saplings. L. camara may be linked to the gradual transition of these tropical deciduous forests into exotic-dominated shrubland, and overall native biodiversity loss.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467411000563,2012,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Prasad, AE",,,C; Land-use; Labile carbon; Recalcitrant carbon; Organic carbon fractions; Soil microbial biomass,MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-MATTER; MANAGEMENT; SEQUESTRATION; DYNAMICS; YIELD; FRACTIONS; ROTATION; TILLAGE; RATIOS,Punjab Agricultural University,"[Benbi, D.

Altogether 219 quadrates were laid out and a total of 13 true mangrove species, belonging to 5 families and 8 genera, were recorded. The total tree density and stand basal area of the study region was 1678.08/ha and 20.33m(2)/ha respectively. The low basal areas indicate the reduced structural development in mangroves. Of the 13 tree species, Avicennia constitutes 56% of the total Important Value Index (IVI) and Avicennia officinalis represents 41% of the IVI in Kerala, followed by Avicennia marina (15%), Rhizophora mucronata (15%), Sonneratia alba (8%) Rhizophora apiculata (7%) and Excoecaria agallocha (7%). The diameter at breast height (DBH) in the study area revealed that 47% of the tree species came under the 1-10cm DBH class.

,,,A3044,588,3045,Biomass carbon of truncated diameter classes in Indian forests,"One major uncertainty in estimating terrestrial carbon flux is the biomass density of the forests being cleared or re-growing. Several studies estimated the forest biomass density in different ways. But most of the studies have focused on forest volume inventories in estimating biomass of different forest types. The major drawback of these inventories is that they often report stand/stock tables only above a minimum diameter, reflecting the dominant interest in inventories of commercial volumes. Especially, in countries like India, where most of the forests are disturbed, they might contain important proportions of the stand biomass. The paper estimates the missing number of trees in the inventories using the frequency of stems in the higher diameter classes. Once the stem frequencies have been estimated completed stand tables may be used for biomass estimation. The study concludes that the error of omission of these small diameter classes is substantial as the inventories fail to include 29.7% of the total stand biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

,,,A2482,591,2483,ANALYSIS OF SEASONAL AND ANNUAL CHANGE OF VEGETATION IN THE INDIAN THAR DESERT USING MODIS DATA,"The western part of India, specifically the dry region, will play an important role in determining the Indian monsoon and even global climate patterns. Drastically change in land use pattern of the region has been observed during last few decades. In this paper, an effort was made to track the seasonal as well as annual changes of vegetation pattern in Jaisalmer district using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products. Apart from this, ground data on vegetation were also collected under vegetation carbon pool assessment programme of ISRO-IGBP. It was found that during the hot summer month of May, the area under NDVI class 0-0.1 is reduced from 98% during 2003 to 95% during 2009 with a simultaneous increase in area under NDVI class 0.1-0.2 from 2 to 5%. During the month of September, area under NDVI class 0.2-0.3 increased from almost negligible during May to 34-39% during normal or surplus rainfall year but only to 3% during a deficit year. From the ground data on vegetation biomass, it was found that Prosopis juliflora and Acacia senegal are the most abundant trees in Jaisalmer region of the desert. The sites with NDVI value >= 0.2 were mostly found with Prosopis juliflora tree. Among shrubs, the most abundant species was Calotropis procera and Zizyphus numularia. From this study, it has been found that MODIS NDVI products may be used to quickly assess the vegetation changes in response to rainfall as well as due to anthroprogenic interventions in desert.",Y,Plot-based or transects,link,2011,ISPRS BHOPAL 2011 WORKSHOP EARTH OBSERVATION FOR TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEM,"Santra, P; Chkraborty, A",,,Tetracerus quadricornis; Diet; Group size; Breeding; Southern India,BIOMASS,Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"[Baskaran, Nagarajan; Kannan, Vaithianathan] Indian Inst Sci, Asian Nat Conservat Fdn, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Baskaran, Nagarajan; Desai, Ajay A.] Bombay Nat Hist Soc, Bombay 400001, Maharashtra, India; [Kannan, Vaithianathan; Thiyagesan, Krishnamoorthy] AVC Coll, Postgrad & Res Dept Zool & Wildlife Biol, Mayiladuthurai 609305, Tamil Nadu, India","Baskaran, N (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Asian Nat Conservat Fdn, Innovation Ctr 1st Floor, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",Forest Department of Tamil Nadu; Bombay Natural History Society,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A0312,592,313,"Quantification of carbon sequestration by urban forest using Landsat 8 OLI and machine learning algorithms in Jodhpur, India","Urban forests play a significant role in carbon cycling. Quantification of Aboveground Biomass (AGB) is critical to understand the role of urban forests in carbon sequestration. In the present study, Machine learning (ML) based regression algorithms (SVM, RF, kNN and XGBoost) have been taken into account for spatial mapping of AGB and carbon for the urban forests of Jodhpur city, Rajasthan, India, with the aid of field-based data and their correlations with spectra and textural variables derived from Landsat 8 OLI data. A total of 198 variables were retrieved from the satellite image, including bands, Vegetation Indices (VIs), linearly transformed variables, and Grey Level Co-occurrence textures (GLCM) taken as independent input variables further reduced to 29 variables using Boruta feature selection method. All the models have been compared where with RF algorithm, R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 16.22 t/ha and MAE = 11.86 t/ha. For kNN algorithm R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 28.04 t/ha and MAE = 24.24 t/ha and SVM where R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 89.21 t/ha and MAE = 74.22 t/ha and the best prediction accuracy has been noted with XGBoost algorithm (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 14.08 t/ha and MAE = 13.66 t/ha) with predicted AGB as 0.51−153.76 t/ha. The study indicates that ML-based regression algorithms have great potential over other linear and multiple regression techniques for spatial mapping of AGB and carbon of urban forests for arid regions.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127445,2022,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,"Uniyal, S; Purohit, S; Chaurasia, K; Amminedu, E; Rao, SS",,,Artinskian; Guadalupian; Depositional environment; Carbon isotope; Biomarker; Godavari valley,TRIASSIC BOUNDARY; ORGANIC-MATTER; ANDHRA-PRADESH; DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT; PALYNOLOGICAL RECORDS; WITBANK COALFIELD; COAL DEPOSITS; SUB BASIN; SEDIMENTS; PALYNOSTRATIGRAPHY,Department of Science & Technology (India); Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP),"[Aggarwal, Neha; Mathews, Runcie Paul; Ansari, Arif Husain; Thakur, Biswajeet; Agrawal, Shailesh] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Aggarwal, N (corresponding author), Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,gold,,,,,,,,,
,,,A3004,593,3005,Liana diversity and distribution in four tropical dry evergreen forests on the Coromandel coast of south India,"Liana diversity was inventoried in four tropical dry evergreen forest sites that are characterized by numerous trees, of short stature and small diameter, and a varying degree of anthropogenic disturbance, on the Coromandel coast of south India. A 1-ha plot was established in each of the four sites and was subdivided into 100 quadrats of 10 m x 10 m. All lianas greater than or equal to1 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) rooted within the plot were enumerated. The species richness and density of lianas, with respect to site disturbance and forest stature, varied across the sites. Liana density totaled 3307 individuals (range 497-1163 individuals ha(-1)) and species richness totaled 39 species (range 24-29 species ha(-1)) representing 34 genera and 24 families. Combretaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae and Vitaceae were the well-represented families. The top five species Strychnos minor, Combretum albidum, Derris ovalifolia, Jasminum angustifolium and Reissantia indica contributed 55% of total density. The slopes of the species-area curves were different for each of the four sites and the curve stabilized in only one site. Of the four climbing modes recognized among the total 39 species, 18 were twiners (56% of the total density). Eight species (24% of density) were tendril climbers and 12 species (16% of density) were scramblers. Hugonia mystax was the only hook climber. All the 39 species and 88% of liana density were encountered within a category of 6 cm dbh or less, and a similar pattern prevailed in the individual sites. Of the three diaspore dispersal modes found among the 39 liana species, animal (64%) and wind (23%) dispersal were predominant over the autochorous mode (13%). Liana diversity and distribution in dry forest communities appear to be influenced by forest stature and site disturbance levels. In the light of the extent of liana diversity and sacred grove status of the study sites, the need for forest conservation, involving local people, is emphasized.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023620901624,2003,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Reddy, MS; Parthasarathy, N",,,,SPECIES RICHNESS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; SURFACE ANALYSIS; ORDINATION; EXAMPLE; MODELS; OLD,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; VetAgro Sup; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Dray, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",,,,,,,,,,,
