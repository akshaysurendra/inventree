,,,A1022,3,1023,Edge effects reduce alpha-diversity but not beta-diversity during community assembly in a human-modified tropical forest,"Edge effects can alter the spatial organization of diversity in fragmented habitats. For tropical forests, however, there has been large variation in the strength and direction of such effects reported by different studies. For long-lived organisms like trees, one reason for inconsistent patterns might be due to most studies having examined patterns of diversity and compositional variation in older life stages that bear the legacy of a forest past. Younger life stages can reveal ongoing processes of assembly, but multi-stage examinations are rare. For seedling, sapling, and adult life stages of trees in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot (India), we examined how proximity to forest edges (edge influence) modified the spatial organization of diversity. Specifically, for each life stage we tested whether edge influence led to loss of alpha- and gamma-diversity and decreased beta-diversity in this landscape. We found lower alpha- and gamma-diversity closer to forest edges, but only for seedlings. Seedling composition at 90-100 m from forest edges diverged from composition of sites within 60 m, suggesting that edge influence restricted the recruitment of some species to interior sites. In contrast, beta-diversity was greater near edges than interior forest for all life stages and most prominently for seedlings. Furthermore, beta-diversity at edges was primarily driven by species turnover, suggesting either marked species-environment associations or dispersal limitation. Low turnover at 90-100 m implies that beta-diversity arose from stochastic fluctuations in occurrences and abundances of the same species set. Overall, we find that high beta-diversity structured spatial patterns of diversity near edges, but recruitment bottlenecks are likely to reduce alpha diversity of forest fragments. Our results also corroborate the need to maintain sufficiently large areas of tropical forest free from edge effects to avoid the loss of interior forest species. To improve landscape-scale diversity of fragmented landscapes, restoration efforts should focus on recovery of species that are unable to regenerate near forest edges.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1996,2019,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Krishnadas, M; Kumar, AN; Comita, LS",,Similar dataset as Osuri et al. 2016,Drainage network; water yield; sediment yield; LU; LC; calibration; watersheds,LAND-USE; WATERSHED SUBDIVISION; GIS; COVER; PRIORITIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; SUBWATERSHEDS; RUNOFF; CALIBRATION; SIMULATION,Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Kakinada; Infosys Limited,"[Parupalli, Sridhar] BVRM, SVECW, Civil Engn Dept, Bhimvaram, India; [Kumari, K.

This landscape comprises a mosaic of cultivation, human habitation and natural vegetation that has been heavily used by people. The natural vegetation is broadly divisible into four categories viz., grasslands, secondary scrub, old-fields and forests. Of these, the grasslands were the most species-rich followed by forests, secondary scrub and old-fields. A total of 615 species of angiosperms were recorded within an area of similar to 10,000 km(2) which represent 389 genera and 94 families. Sampling of forested landscape revealed a sizable number of rare species within frequency range of 0.001- 0.1%. These species showed very low seedling abundance and poor regeneration. The overall, landscape level diversity (gamma-diversity) of the forested landscape was 4.035, to which shrubs contributed the most. The scrub vegetation was dominated by woody climbers which frequently formed thickets. Diversity of woody perennials was very low in the plantations. The composition and diversity of various grassland communities have been compared with respect to topography and canopy openings reflecting different light regimes.

To describe the structural and functional differences in tree communities from interior to outside forests with in small PA, we quantitatively analyzed the vegetation of Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, a rich primate habitat of Northeast India. Vegetation was sampled at a parts per thousand yen10 cm girth at breast height by 10 m x 500 m sized 20 line transects (10 ha) laid in the interior (N = 7), peripheral (N = 7) and outside (N = 6) zones of this sanctuary. All transects were ordinated by Principal Component Analysis based on correlation between diversity and existing disturbance indices. We found significant differences (P < 0.05) in taxonomic richness and diversity indices between the habitat. Van diagram confirmed greater unique species richness in the interior zone (64) than peripheral (28) and outside (6) zones. Overall density (ha(-1)) did not differed across the zones, but basal area (m(2) ha(-1)) was significantly (P < 0.01) high in peripheral zone. Vertical distribution of stem density was linearly declined across zones ( > 0.70; P < 0.01) with increase in the canopy height. Horizontal distribution of adult stems showed significant inverse quadratic relationship ( > 0.80; P < 0.001), which suggests very low density of canopy forming voluminous trees in the interior zone.

,,,A0490,7,491,A critical review of forest biomass estimation equations in India,"Plant biomass is an integral part of the global carbon cycle and a renewable energy source that can deaccelerate the rising global temperature. India has 71 million ha (M ha) of land under forests represented by tropical to alpine ecosystems. Numerous direct and indirect species-specific and mixed-species equations have been used for biomass estimation in India. Biomass estimation equations that facilitate the prediction of aboveground biomass (AGB) stocks non-destructively across India are still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this review is to (i) assess the existing species-specific biomass estimation equations for trees, bamboos, palms, and bananas in India, (ii) assess and identify the most appropriate multi-species biomass estimation equations for AGB estimation across India, and (iii) define the critical research gaps in biomass estimation in India. The literature search found 85 species-specific and six multi-species AGB estimation equations reported from India. It was also found that a 50% of these equations were based on the power-law function using diameter at breast height (D) as the predictor variable. We carried out a multi-fold validation to compare the multi-species equation's compatibility by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE). The estimated RMSE values of the six reported multi-species equations showed that the following two equations could be effectively used for estimation of AGB: (i) lnAGB= 0.349+1.316 lnGBH and (ii) AGB= (0.18D2.16) × 1.32.

,,,A1032,8,1033,"Phytosociology of stratification in a lowland tropical rainforest occurring north of the Tropic of Cancer in Meghalaya, India","Stratification in lowland rainforests of Meghalaya, India, which represent the westernmost limit of the rainforests north of the Tropic of Cancer, was studied in horizontal and vertical planes to elucidate the patterns in stacking of species diversity and community attributes, and to draw comparisons with rainforests of 'Indo-Malaya' ecozone (biogeographical realm). All individuals >= 10 cm GBH (girth at breast height) were enumerated in six transects of 10 m width and up to 500 m length covering 2.45 ha area. The stratification of whole assemblage of species in vertical plane is referred to as 'storey structure' (=height class distribution), which explains structural complexity. In horizontal plane, it is typically referred to as 'stand structure' (=girth class distribution), which explains structural heterogeneity. The stratification of an individual species in vertical plane is referred to as 'loftiness' and in horizontal plane, it is frequently referred to as 'population structure'. The stand structure was characterized by a negative exponential relationship or a reverse J-shaped curve, which is typical of a well regenerating forest stand. The storey structure was characterized by the low stature of the rainforest (<30 m), subtle layering in the canopy with dearth of discrete multi-stories, narrower widths of the stories and a thick understory. The cluster analysis and 'candlestick charts' showed that the dominant species spatially segregated in canopy height to profile three strata, viz., an understory of juveniles and shrubs below 5 m, a middle-storey of intermediate trees between 5 and 15 m, and an overstory of large trees between 15 and 25 m. Emergent trees of a few species may reach up to 30 m. The individuals tended to scatter in increasingly wider range of height classes from a lower to the next higher girth class, creating a 'torchlight scatter' pattern, with a tendency to concentrate towards smaller height classes due to stochastic factors, which potentially influence vertical growth proportionate to diametric growth. In comparison to equatorial rainforests of Malaysia and seasonal rainforests of southwestern China, the rainforests of Meghalaya are short-statured at the geographic extremity of the occurrence of rainforest biome in Asia-Pacific region, owing to floristic composition, site quality factors, excessively higher quantities of rainfall and high differential of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Despite limited diversity of megaphanerophytes, these rainforests deserve concerted conservation efforts as they stack high diversity of meso-, micro- and nano-phanerophytes.

,,,A1341,9,1342,A systematic review on the aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of Indian forest ecosystems,"Background: Tropical forests play a crucial role as source and sink in global carbon cycle. Development and other anthropogenic activities have led to degradation of forest land, and ultimately, it results in loss of biodiversity and increases concentration of CO2 in atmospheres. Therefore, there is urgent need to estimate regional and national level carbon stock for making forest-based policies and strategies for mitigation of CO2. Patchy and sporadic information is available on biomass and carbon stock of Indian forests. The paper presents a systematic review and comprehensive account of studies conducted in different forest types in India. Result: There are six major forest types found in India consisting of 15 groups and other subgroups with peculiar characteristics. Methodologies used by researchers for biomass/carbon stock estimation are destructive, nondestructive, tree inventories data, species-specific biomass estimation, and remote sensing. Majority of estimates are based on nondestructive allometric equation approach. Studies showed positive correlation between tree species, diameter at breast height, and biomass/carbon stock. Small-and medium-sized growing trees, invasive species, mixed forest, Agroforestry, and Agrosilviculture also play an important role in atmospheric carbon assimilation. The results of diverse forest carbon stock studies are broadly categorized in North, Central, and Southern India. Present review will be helpful for developing conservation policies and decision to increase carbon stock and also REDD+ program for particular forest ecosystem. Conclusion: The systematic literature review was carried out to gather and summarize information from different studies conducted on forest ecosystems and quantification methods used for biomass estimation and carbon stock in different forests types and states of India. In general, great variability occurs in aboveground biomass and carbon stock on account of climatic and geographic differences. To obtain good and accurate estimations, following nondestructive approach, species-specific density-based equations are required from different habitats and also in relation to degradation status of forests. As such regional volume equations would increase error of estimations. The comprehensive account of data would be helpful to formulate strategies based on carbon sequestration in Indian forests for CO2 mitigation.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-018-0130-z,2018,ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Salunkhe, O; Khare, PK; Kumari, R; Khan, ML",,,Automation; chest X-rays; lung region symmetry; pulmonary abnormalities; screening; tuberculosis,RAPID MOLECULAR-DETECTION; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; TUBERCULOSIS; SHAPE; RADIOGRAPHS; SEGMENTATION; NETWORKS; FEATURES; LIVER,University of South Dakota; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM),"[Santosh, K.

Location The Linganamakki region (State of Karnataka) of the Central Western Ghats of India. Method We selected thirty vegetation thickets ranging from 4 to 439 m(2) in area in the vicinity of rain forest. The area of each small thicket was estimated as an oval using its maximum length and its maximum width. When the shape was irregular (mostly in large thickets) the limits of the thicket were mapped and the area calculated from the map. Plant species were identified, the number of individuals was estimated and their heights measured. Results There was a progression in the thickets from early to late successional species. Small thickets were characterized by ecotone species and savanna trees such as Catunaregam dumetorum . Savanna trees served as a nucleus for thicket formation. Colonizing species were mostly bird-dispersed. As succession proceeded in larger thickets, the proportion of evergreen, late-successional rain forest trees increased. The species composition of the large thickets differed depending on the species composition of reproductive adults in the nearby forested areas. The species within small thickets were also found in the large thickets. The nestedness in species composition suggested that species turnover was deterministic based on thicket size. Human disturbance (leaf and wood collection by the local populations) affected the species composition and the species-area relationship of thickets. Main conclusions Vegetation thickets are nodal centres for rain forest colonization within grasslands. They expand and replace savanna. Early successional bird-dispersed species established around savanna trees followed by late-successional rain forest trees dispersed from the nearby forest by birds. Restoration programmes that reproduce natural successional processes such as those observed in thickets will be more successful and less expensive than the methods currently being employed, where trees are individually planted in grassland.

Location The south-westernmost extension of the Tibetan Plateau, an arid mountainous area, in East Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir State, India. Methods Species composition was recorded for 369 plots (each 100 m2). Plots, sampled from 4180 m a.s.l. (bottom of the Indus Valley) up to 6060 m a.s.l.

Results TWINSPAN clusters discriminated eight ecologically interpretable vegetation types, corresponding to the main habitats in the area: animal resting places, salt marshes, semi-deserts and steppes, shrublands, alpine screes and boulder fields, alpine grasslands, water bodies and subnival zone. The most important environmental factors influencing the species composition were altitude, soil moisture and salinity. Screes and alpine grasslands were found to be the most species-rich. The species were ranged into 20 growth forms with regard to life-form and clonality, with growth forms showing different changes in proportion among vegetation types and along the different environmental gradients.

,,,A1535,12,1536,Impact of biogas interventions on forest biomass and regeneration in southern India,"Programs to provide alternative energy sources such as biogas improve indoor air quality and potentially reduce pressure on forests from fuelwood collection. This study tests whether biogas intervention is associated with higher forest biomass and forest regeneration in degraded forests in Chikkaballapur district in Southern India. Using propensity score matching, we find that forest plots in proximity to villages with biogas interventions (treatment) had greater forest biomass than comparable plots around villages without biogas (control). We also found significantly higher sapling abundance and diversity in treatment than control plots despite no significant difference in seedling abundances and diversity in treatment forests, suggesting that plants have a higher probability of reaching sapling stage. These results indicate the potential for alternative energy sources that reduce dependence on fuelwood to promote regeneration of degraded forests. However, forest regrowth is not uniform across treatments and is limited by soil nutrients and biased towards species that are light demanding, fire-resistant and can thrive in poor soil conditions.

A change was noted in the above region due to physiographic differences and anthropogenic disturbances. Annually the soil moisture (SM) content across the different study sites ranged from 7.5 to 24.3% being maximum in forest sites compared to savanna and cropland sites. The NH4+-N, NO3--N and MB-N concentrations varied from 4.3 to 10.2 mu g/g, 1.1 to 5.8 mu g/g and 21.3 to 90.2 mu g/g dry soil, respectively, with minimum values in the wet and maximum values in the dry season. The trend of seasonal variation in net N-mineralization was similar to that of moisture content but counter to the concentrations of inorganic-N and MB-N.

In the 1980s, the State Government of Rajasthan declared wildlife-rich areas (14690 km(2)) located outside PA, as Closed Areas (CA) to prohibit hunting activities. In 2002, due to an amendment of the WPA of 1972, these CA lost their PA status, thus putting into question, the future of these endangered species-rich ecosystems. To inform future management decisions, a rapid biodiversity assessment was conducted across seven former CA in the arid landscapes of western Rajasthan. Furthermore, the dynamics of biodiversity and conservation practices over time was also assessed through interviews of 3357 adults from 2470 households in the region. Due to the natural low productivity of arid regions, the mean tree density (5.2 +/- 0.8 individual ha(-1)) was found significantly lower (P = 0.001) than the mean shrub density (114.4 +/- 31.4 individual ha(-1)) particularly where human interferences were recorded, while species richness and diversity (Sobs and Shannon indices) were higher for trees (16 +/- 0.0 and 2.4, respectively) than the shrubs (13 +/- 0.1 and 1.8, respectively). Prosopis cineraria was assessed, as the most dominant and exploited tree species. Ecological densities of all the wild ungulates (11.7 +/- 1.8 individual km(-2)) were quite comparable to other well-guarded PA of India. However, high density of domestic livestock (94.6 +/- 7.2 individual km(-2)) provides severe competition to them. Indian desert fox (Vulpes vulpes pusilla) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), adapted to survive amongst human dominated landscapes, were the most abundant canids (0.9 +/- 0.2 individual km(-2) and 0.6 +/- 0.1 individual km(-2), respectively), where the latter was considerably responsible for wild ungulate mortalities. State Government records and over 69% of the interviewees (n = 2331) reported that the region's wildlife populations had significantly declined during the past two decades in absence of any designated protection regime. Therefore, to protect this endangered biodiversity, reconsideration of the future conservation status of these former CA should be prioritized, as Conservation Reserves - CR or Community Conservation Reserves - CCR with the assistance of local communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2018.07.006,2018,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,"Bhattacharjee, S; Kidwai, Z; Bhattarai, S; Bajpai, H; Reddy, GV; Yessoufou, K",,,carbon sequestration; fallow period; greenhouse gas emission; payments for ecosystem services; secondary forest regeneration; slash and burn,BIODIVERSITY CO-BENEFITS; BURN AGRICULTURE; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SECONDARY FORESTS; SWIDDEN CULTIVATION; TROPICAL FORESTS; RAIN-FORESTS; LARGE TREES; DYNAMICS; REGION,University of Sheffield,"[Borah, Joli R.; Evans, Karl L.; Edwards, David P.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","Borah, JR (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.",ACCE (Adapting to the Challenges of a Changing Environment) Doctoral Training Partnership,"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Three study stands exposed to different intensities of disturbances were identified, viz., undisturbed (2.4 ha) in the core zone of the park, moderately disturbed (2.1 ha) in the periphery of the park and highly disturbed (2.7 ha) outside the park area. In total 200 plant species belonging to 73 families were recorded in three stands. Tree density and basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity. The densities of tree saplings and seedlings were lower in the disturbed stands than in the undisturbed stand. Species like Altingia excelsa, Olea dioica, Terminalia chebula, Mesua ferrea and Shorea assamica in the undisturbed stand and Albizia procera alone in the moderately disturbed stand contributed more than 50% of the total tree density in respective stands. The undisturbed stand contained young tree population. In the highly disturbed stand, the tree density was scarce, but had uncut trees of higher girth class (> 210 cm GBH). Low shrub density was recorded in both disturbed stands due to frequent human disturbances; the broken canopy and direct sunlight enhanced the abundance of herbs in these stands.

In the present study, we explore the potential of satellite datasets in identifying the patterns in species richness in part of three global biodiversity hotspots falling in India viz., Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats. We used generalized linear models to correlate remote sensing based vegetation indices (VIs) and physiographic indices (PIs) with plant richness calculated using 1264, 1114, and 1004 field plots across 21 different forest vegetation classes in Himalaya, Indo-Burma, and Western Ghats respectively. Three different vegetation indices ranked highest in explaining the variance in plant richness in the three hotspots. The variance in species richness explained by models based on only VIs was highest (69%, P<0.01) for Bamboo vegetation in Indo Burma hotspot with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, followed by that for dry deciduous forest in Western Ghats (57%, P<0.001) with Normalized Difference Water Index, and for grasslands (54%, P<0.05) in Himalaya by Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The explained variance increased with combined models that are based on PIs and VIs to up to 85% (P<0.05). Overall, we observed very high correlation between VIs and plant richness in open canopy vegetation classes with low species richness such as grasslands, scrubs, and dry deciduous forests, followed by vegetation classes with moderately dense canopy.

,,,B0010,22,3355,Greater stability of carbon capture in species-rich natural forests compared to species-poor plantations,"Abstract Tree plantations and forest restoration are leading strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration and mitigating climate change. While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercial monoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear. Using a natural experiment in the Western Ghats of India, where late-20th century conservation laws prohibited timber extraction from monodominant plantations and natural forests within nature reserves, we assessed forests and plantations for aboveground C storage and the magnitude and temporal stability of rates of photosynthetic C capture (gross primary production). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that species-rich forests show greater temporal stability of C capture, and are more resistant to drought, than monodominant plantations. Carbon stocks in monodominant teak ( Tectona grandis ) and Eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus spp. ) plantations were 30%â€“50% lower than in natural evergreen forests, but differed little from moist-deciduous forests. Plantations had 4%â€“9% higher average C capture rates (estimated using the Enhanced Vegetation Indexâ€“EVI) than natural forests during wet seasons, but up to 29% lower C capture during dry seasons across the 2000â€“18 period. In both seasons, the rate of C capture by plantations was less stable across years, and decreased more during drought years (i.e. lower resistance to drought), compared to forests. Thus, even as certain monodominant plantations could match natural forests for C capture and storage potential, plantations are unlikely to match the stabilityâ€“and hence reliabilityâ€“of C capture exhibited by forests, particularly in the face of increasing droughts and other climatic perturbations. Promoting natural forest regeneration and/or multi-species native tree plantations instead of plantation monocultures could therefore benefit climate change mitigation efforts, while offering valuable co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab5f75,2020,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Osuri, AM; Gopal, A; Raman, TRS; DeFries, R; Cook-Patton, SC; Naeem, S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying carbon stock from such ecosystems is very important in understanding the global carbon cycle. Geospatial technology plays an important role in this context, offers quick and accurate forest biomass carbon assessments at larger spatial scales. We combined remote sensing and field measured data for spatial mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock in varied vegetation types of northern part of Karnataka, India. Moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (250 m) satellite data was utilized in development of relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and field measured AGB and carbon stock. Field measured AGB ranged between 30.09 and 301.51 Mg ha−1 across different vegetation types. Regression model (Y = 52.904X − 10.362) with the highest coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.613) was obtained between AGB (Y) and NDVI (X) of the December month. The regression model developed further was used in predicting the AGB and carbon stock at regional level. Total AGB was estimated at 0.20–30.80 Mt and carbon stock of 0.09–14.10 Mt.

The policy is not only crucial to India's ambitious goal of achieving 33 per cent forest and tree cover but also to mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture sector. Dynamic CO2FIX-v3.1 model has been used to estimate the carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of existing agroforestry systems (AFS) for simulation period of 30 years in twenty six districts from ten selected states of India. The observed number of trees on farmers' field in these districts varied from 1.81 to 204 per hectare with an average value of 19.44 trees per hectare. The biomass in the tree component varied from 0.58 to 48.50 Mg DM ha(-1), whereas, the total biomass (tree and crop) ranged from 4.96 to 58.96 Mg DM ha(-1). The soil organic carbon ranged from 4.28 to 24.13 Mg C ha(-1). The average estimated carbon sequestration potential of the AFS, representing varying edapho-climatic conditions, on farmers field at country level was 0.21 Mg C ha(-1)yr(-1).

,,,A1286,26,1287,Quantifying carbon stocks in shifting cultivation landscapes under divergent management scenarios relevant to REDD,"Shifting cultivation dominates many tropical forest regions. It is expanding into old-growth forests, and fallow period duration is rapidly decreasing, limiting secondary forest recovery. Shifting cultivation is thus a major driver of carbon emissions through deforestation and forest degradation, and of biodiversity loss. The impacts of shifting cultivation on carbon stocks have rarely been quantified, and the potential for carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (PES), such as REDD+, to protect carbon in shifting cultivation landscapes is unknown. We present empirical data on aboveground carbon stocks in old-growth forest and shifting cultivation landscapes in northeast India, a hotspot of threatened biodiversity. We then model landscape-level carbon stocks under business-as-usual scenarios, via expansion into the old-growth forest or decreasing fallow periods, and intervention scenarios in which REDD+ is used to either reduce deforestation of primary or secondary forest or increase fallow period duration. We found substantial recovery of carbon stocks as secondary forest regenerates, with a 30-yr fallow storing about one-half the carbon of an old-growth forest. Business-as-usual scenarios led to substantial carbon loss, with an 80% reduction following conversion of old-growth forest to a 30-yr shifting cultivation cycle and, relative to a 30-yr cultivation landscape, a 70% reduction when switching to a 5-yr cultivation cycle. Sparing old-growth forests from deforestation using protected areas and intensifying cropping in the remaining area of shifting cultivation is the most optimal strategy for carbon storage. In areas lacking old-growth forest, substantial carbon stocks accumulate over time by sparing fallows for permanent forest regeneration. Successful implementation of REDD+ in shifting cultivation landscapes can help avert global climate change by protecting forest carbon, with likely co-benefits for biodiversity.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.1764,2018,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Borah, JR; Evans, KL; Edwards, DP",,,Tea cultivation; Deforestation; Population growth; Urbanization,PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA; COVER CHANGE; FOREST CONVERSION; DEFORESTATION; IMPACT; AGRICULTURE; VEGETATION; PROXIMATE; DYNAMICS; MALAYSIA,Polish Academy of Sciences,"[Prokop, Pawel] Polish Acad Sci, Dept Geoenvironm Res, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Jana 22, PL-31018 Krakow, Poland","Prokop, P (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Dept Geoenvironm Res, Inst Geog & Spatial Org, Jana 22, PL-31018 Krakow, Poland.",National Science Centre (Poland) [2012/05/B/ST10/00309]; Indian National Science Academy,,,,,,,,,,

Dual polarized ENVISAT C-band Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of IS2 beam mode i.e., incidence angle ranges from 18.8(0)-26.1(0) were analyzed. The DN values of the ENVISAT-ASAR data are converted to backscattering coefficients. The forest in the study area holds 129-203 Mg ha(-1) (1 Mg=10(3) kg) of Biomass. Scatter plots were drawn between backscattering coefficients and Volume, Basal Area and Biomass for VV, VH and HV polarizations. Results show that with increase in the biomass levels, backscattering coefficient also increases. The backscattering coefficient of HH has significant correlation with the biophysical parameters whereas VH and VV are not well correlated. This relationship can be utilized to estimate the forest biophysical parameters of the study area.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.693304,2006,MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND ENVIRONMENT V,"Jha, CS; Rangaswamy, M; Vyjayanthi, N; Murthy, MSR",,,microwave remote sensing; SAR interferometry; interferometric coherence; the canopy digital surface model; envisat- ASAR,,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)","[Kumar, Praveen; Krishna, A.

Present study demonstrates the use of high resolution IRS1C data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with supervised classification to define different types of forest cover in protected and unprotected areas for growing forest stock assessment of Shorea robusta Gaertn. F. (Sal) dominated forest. Further, a map of the same was generated which was subsequently validated using phyto-sociological field data in Dehradun, India. Three forest canopy density classes, viz., 10-30%, 30-70% and >70% could be differentiated. Aim of this study was to test usefulness of LISS-III and test its efficacy for assessment of total growing stock and further in generalising the method for the whole area. The homogeneous forest strata were field inventoried for individual tree (>= 10 cm dbh) diameter using sample quadrats at each of the study sites. The plot inventory data was analysed to arrive at image level growing stock estimates. An inspection review was carried out to be familiar with the study area using hard copy of LISS-III data to correlate the image. A scheme of forest classification was developed and the forests were stratified into moist Siwalik sal forest (3C/C2a), dry Siwalik sal forest (5B/C1a) and non-forest. High level of accuracy was achieved by ground truthing. The objective of the stratification was to categorize the forest into homogeneous strata. The biomass measurement from same sample plots was also integrated into the remote sensing technique for large spatial information on AGB distribution. The study revealed that protected sal forest has maximum volume and growing stock per hectare followed by unprotected sal forest. Same was also true for sal associates. The study also shows good scope of high resolution data for growing stock and forest carbon assessment, opening scope in estimating carbon sequestration potential of forest which may help researchers and policy makers to understand global and regional CO2 cycle.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2325115,2018,"REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XX","Srivastava, P; Birman, S; Pandey, S",,,,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; BIOLOGICAL AEROSOL-PARTICLES; NATURAL AMAZONIAN AEROSOL; HIGH-ALTITUDE SITE; ORGANIC AEROSOLS; FUNGAL SPORES; PARTICULATE MATTER; AIRBORNE BACTERIA; ISOMER-RATIOS; SOUTH-ASIA,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"[Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun] IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rajput, Prashant; Chauhan, Amit Singh; Gupta, Tarun] IIT Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn CESE, Atmospher Particle Technol Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India","Chauhan, AS (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Chauhan, AS (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn CESE, Atmospher Particle Technol Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2257,35,2258,The rain-runoff response of tropical humid forest ecosystems to use and reforestation in the Western Ghats of India,"The effects of forest degradation and use and establishment of tree-plantations on degraded or modified forest ecosystems at multi-decadal time-scales using tree-plantations on the streamflow response are less studied in the humid tropics when compared to deforestation and forest conversion to agriculture. In the Western Ghats of India (Uttar Kannada, Karnataka State), a previous soil hydraulic conductivity survey linked with rain IDF (intensity-duration-frequency) had suggested a greater occurrence of infiltration-excess overland within the degraded forest and reforested areas and thus potentially higher streamflow (Bonell et al., 2010). We further tested these predictions in Uttar Kannada by establishing experimental basins ranging from 7 to 23 ha across three ecosystems, (1) remnant tropical evergreen Forest (NF), (2) heavily-used former evergreen forest which now has been converted to tree savanna, known as degraded forest (DF) and (3) exotic Acacia plantations (AC, Acacia auriculiformis) on degraded former forest land. In total, 11 basins were instrumented (3 NF, 4 AC and 4 DF) in two geomorphological zones, i.e., Coastal and Up-Ghat (Malnaad) and at three sites (one Coastal, two Up-Ghat). The rainfall-streamflow observations collected (at daily and also at a 36 min time resolutions in the Coastal basins) over a 2-3 year period (2003-2005) were analysed. In both the Coastal and Up-Ghat basins, the double mass curves showed during the rainy season a consistent trend in favour of more proportion of streamflow in the rank order DF > AC > NF. These double mass curves provide strong evidence that overland flow is progressively becomes a more dominant stormflow pathway. Across all sites. NF converted 28.4 +/- 6.41(stdev%) a of rainfall into total streamflow in comparison to 32.7 +/- 6.97(stdev%) in AC and 45.3 +/- 9.61(stdev%) in DF. Further support for the above trends emerges from the quickflow ratio Q(F)/Q for the Coastal basins. There are much higher values for both the DF and AC land covers, and their rank order DF > AC > NF. The quickflow response ratio Q(F)/P is also the highest for the DF basin, and along with the Q(F)/Q ratio, can exceed 90%. The corresponding delayed flow response ratios. Q(D)/P clearly show the largest Q(D) yields as a proportion of event precipitation from the Forest (NF1). The application of linear model supported these differences (e.g. 10-36% difference between NF and DF, p < 0.001) in the storm hydrologic response of the Coastal basins. The exception was Q(F)/P where there was a higher uncertainty connected with inter-basin mean differences. Cross-correlation plots for rain-streamflow and corresponding lag regression models for three storm events in the Coastal basins suggested the existence of alternative stormflow pathways with multiple lags with peaks between similar to 12 and 24 h in NF, compared to respective bimodal peaks at similar to 1 and 16 h in AC and similar to 1 and 12 h in DF. The long time lags for NF are suggestive of deep subsurface stormflow and groundwater as the contributing sources to the storm hydrograph. The short time lags in DF and AC are indicative of overland flow and so 'memory' of the previous degraded land cover is retained in AC as supported by previous hydraulic conductivity data. As potential and actual evapotranspiration is likely to be depressed during the monsoon, differences in streamflow and run-off responses between land-cover types is largely attributed to differences in soil infiltration and hydrologic pathways. Enhancing infiltration and reducing run-off in managed ecosystems should be explored in the terms of the context of other ecosystem services and biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Land cover and vegetation were spatially analyzed by digitally classifying IRS 1D LISS III satellite data using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Later, the variations in structure and diversity in different forest types and classes were quantified by adopting quadratic sampling procedures. Nine land-cover types were delineated: teak forest, dense mixed forest, degraded mixed forest, Sal mixed forest, open mixed forest, young teak plantation, grasslands, agriculture, habitation, and water bodies. The classification accuracy for different land-use classes ranged from 71.23% to 100%. The highest accuracy was observed in water bodies and grassland, followed by habitation and agriculture, teak forest, degraded mixed forest, and dense mixed forest. The accuracy was lower in open mixed forest, and sal mixed forest. Results revealed that density of different forest types varied from 324. to 733 trees ha(-1), basal area from 8.13 to 28.87 m(2)-ha(-1) and number of species from 20 to 40. Similarly, the diversity ranged from 1.36 to 2.98, concentration of dominance from 0.06 to 0.49, species richness from 3.88 to 6.86, and beta diversity from 1.29 to 2.21. The sal mixed forest type recorded the highest basal area, diversity was highest in the dense mixed forest, and the teak forest recorded maximum density, which was poor in degraded mixed forests.

,,,A1709,38,1710,Forest observational studies: an alternative to designed experiments,"With Ernst Assmann's appointment to the chair of Forest Yield Science in Munich in 1951, he assumed responsibility for the maintenance of the extensive network of growth-and-yield plots of the Bavarian Forest Research Institute. This network, with some plots having been remeasured since 1870, proved to be a rich source of observations, and constituted the empirical basis for Assmann's fundamental theories in production ecology. Realizing the strategic value of long-term field observations, scientists are using ( a) designed experiments and ( b) observational studies to study forest structure and dynamics. This contribution is an attempt to clarify fundamental differences, and to present examples, of these two approaches. We present recent developments regarding the installation of Designed Experiments and show that rigorous experimental design, usually found in planted forests and based on very specific manipulations, that are normally not found in the natural environment is required to address a particular hypothesis that cannot be tested by merely using available observations. We also present examples of new Forest Observational Networks established in China, India, Africa and America. These alternative research infrastructures are especially suitable for the study of natural forests that exhibit a high diversity of tree species with varying size and age structures. Our conclusion is that Forest Observational Studies are emerging as an important alternative to Designed Experiments because they provide a vast amount of information about complex natural forest communities rather quickly. However, long-term commitment is essential to ensure a steady flow of observations about forest dynamics. Manipulated experiments and observational studies can be complementary, but the optimum use of both installations requires careful planning and coordination.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10342-016-0952-0,2016,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,"von Gadow, K; Zhao, XH; Tewari, VP; Zhang, CY; Kumar, A; Rivas, JJC; Kumar, R",,,ALOS PALSAR; Landsat TM; polarization; backscatter; tropical deciduous forest; biomass; Munger; Bihar,ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; SAR; LIDAR,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Space Applications Centre (SAC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India","[Sinha, Suman; Jeganathan, C.] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India; [Sharma, L.

Location Goa state is located between 15degrees48' N and 14degrees53'54'' N and 74degrees20'13'' E and 73degrees40'33'' E, in the northern part of the Western Ghats, India. Method A list of endemic plants from the study area was prepared using available floristic works and checklists of endemic plants of India. Based on preliminary field observations carried out in the study area, major habitats such as plateaus, moist deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, evergreen forests and mangroves were identified for the subsequent intensive survey of endemics. Voucher specimens for all the endemic species were collected, processed using conventional herbarium techniques and deposited in the Herbarium, Department of Botany, Goa University. Species were identified using local and regional floras and their identity was confirmed at various herbaria along the Western Ghats. Data on their life-form types, habitat and phenology was recorded in the field. Phenological observations were made every fortnight. A computerized data base was generated incorporating details on their life-form type, phenology and habitat. Results A floristic survey of endemic plants of the Western Ghats in Goa resulted in the collection of 113 endemic species. Life-form analysis reveals that herbaceous endemics are the most dominant followed by trees, shrubs and climbers. Plateaus in the study area harbour the largest number of endemic species, especially herbs. Endemic trees are distributed in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forests. Endemic species in the study area show different peak and lean seasons of flowering depending on their life-form type, habitat and ecological factors like temperature and rainfall/moisture content in the soil. Main conclusions The plateaus in the northern part of the Western Ghats are unique, being species rich with herbaceous endemics. These ephemerals are closely associated with the rainfall patterns thus; any change of moisture regime over the long-term will have an impact on the distribution of these endemics.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01067.x,2004,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Joshi, VC; Janarthanam, MK",,,disturbance; microbial biomass; soil nutrient pool; tropical wet-evergreen forest; northeast India,SUBTROPICAL HUMID FOREST; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; EXTRACTION METHOD; PLANT NUTRIENTS; PHOSPHORUS; RESPIRATION; GLUCOSE; CARBON,North Eastern Regional Institute of Science & Technology (NERIST); North Eastern Hill University,"North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Restorat Ecol Lab, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India; North Eastern Hill Univ, Dept Bot, Meghalaya 793022, India","Arunachalam, K (corresponding author), North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry, Restorat Ecol Lab, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Stratified random sampling of tree species was done by placing minimum 15 quadrats of 10 x 10 m at each aspect and altitude. The results reveal that along the altitudinal gradient there were three types of forest communities in the Sanctuary viz., chir pine (Pinus roxburghii), oakchir pine (Quercus leucotrichophora and Pinus roxburghii) and oak (Quercus floribunda and Quercus leucotrichophora). Rhododendron arboreum, Cornus macrophylla and Lyonia ovalifolia were main associates of these forest communities. The oak forests had larger shrub population as compared to chir pine. Myrsine africana was the most dominant shrub across the altitudinal gradient, whereas few shrub species were restricted to a certain altitudinal range. The regeneration of chir pine was best at lower altitude on south and east aspects, which indicates that it mostly regenerates on warm and dry slopes. In general, the regeneration potential in most of the tree species declines with the altitude. The density of saplings and seedlings also represented the dominant species at each altitudinal range, which indicates the cyclic regeneration of forests in the Sanctuary area.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1134/S1067413610010157,2010,RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Majila, BS; Kala, CP",,,Development; gender; institutions; particular and general interests; resource management; structure,COMMUNITY; GENDER,Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Arora-Jonsson, S (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Box 7012, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",,,,,,,,,,,

The mean annual dry weight of P kesiya fine roots did not vary significantly between the stands, but the coarse root mass increased significantly from the 6- to 23-year-old stand. However, herbaceous fine roots and rhizomes showed a reverse trend. Live roots (biomass) showed a higher N and P concentration than the necromass (dead root mass). Nutrient concentrations were greater in the fine roots compared to coarse roots. N and P accumulation was maximum in the 6-year-old stand and minimum in the 15-year-old stand. P. kesiya fine roots decomposed in a three-phased manner in all the stands. The first phase, lasting about 30 days, was characterised by a slow rate of weight loss. This was followed by a rapid phase of weight loss up to 90 days, with an average weight loss of 7.7 mg day(-1), and the third phase showed a slow decay pattern (1.2 mg day(-1)).

,,,A2734,45,2735,Ecosystem impacts of disturbance in a dry tropical forest in southern India,"Indian forests provide a multitude of services to vast populations. Common human activities including livestock grazing, fuelwood extraction and burning have the potential to impact forest ecosystem structure and function. The effects of these activities on vegetation, ecology and soil properties were investigated in Bandipur National Park (BNP) in southern India. Data were collected from 200 sites in four watersheds within the park. Sample sites spanned a degradation gradient measured by a field disturbance index (FDI). This paper focusses on the impacts on vegetation structure, diversity and composition, and integrates impacts on soil. Shrub and tree species were inventoried and evaluated in plots 10-m in diameter. The tree layer was dominated by Anogeissus-Emblica-Tectona species. The understory was dominated by invasives Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara, and native gymnosporia emarginata. Vegetation plot heights, canopy cover and tree diameters were negatively correlated with field disturbance resulting in stunted forest stature in degraded sites. Vegetation composition in degraded watersheds was dominated by small woody tree species and a greater diversity of shrub species. Ordination analysis was used to integrate soil data with vegetation and disturbance, revealing that deciduous forest in the park is degrading to scrub forest along with negative impacts on soil characteristics. Consequences of services currently enjoyed by local populations are discussed.

This study assessed the effect of continuous N and P additions for 6 years on the size distribution and properties of soil aggregates in forest-ecotone-savanna gradient. Addition of N significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates in forest and ecotone, whereas the same input significantly decreased their proportion in the savanna. Consequently, the stability of soil aggregates increased significantly in forest and ecotone, whereas it decreased significantly in the savanna. The effect of P addition on soil aggregate stability was marginal. N addition also altered the biological and chemical qualities of soil aggregates. It caused increase in microbial biomass C (MBC) associated with macroaggregates in forest and ecotone; however, in savanna, MBC increased in the microaggregates. P addition did not affect the amount of MBC in both types of soil aggregates. Because of rapid accumulation of applied N and P in the microbial biomass, the ratios of MBC to microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) as well as microbial biomass phosphorous (MBP) were decreased in both aggregates. Overall, the effect of N addition was more marked than that of P addition, suggesting that N is more limiting than P in these dry tropical ecosystems. In the current scenario of N loading, continued soil N loading in forest may lead to increased macroaggregates with associated MBC and MBN and greater aggregate stability. In contrast, the extensively distributed savannas may show the reverse trend leading to a decrease in soil fertility.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01702.x,2008,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Tripathi, SK; Kushwaha, CP; Singh, KP",,,secondary succession; secondary tree species; pioneer shrubs; grazing; usufruct benefits; common property resources; India,COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES; DRY EVERGREEN FORESTS; DIVERSITY; GRASSLANDS; CONSERVATION; COMMUNITIES; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; RAINFALL; SAVANNA,Pondicherry University,"[Kinhal, Vijayalaxmi; Parthasarathy, N.] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Puducherry 605014, India","Kinhal, V (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Puducherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1116,48,1117,"Plant diversity of the Kangchenjunga Landscape, Eastern Himalayas","The Kangchenjunga Landscape (KL) in the Eastern Himalayas is a transboundary complex shared by Bhutan, India, and Nepal. It forms a part of the 'Himalayan Biodiversity Hotspot' and is one of the biologically richest landscapes in the Eastern Himalayas. In this paper, we use secondary information to review and consolidate the knowledge on the flora of the KL. We reviewed 215 journal articles, analysed the history of publications on the flora of the KL, their publication pattern in terms of temporal and spatial distribution and key research areas. Our review shows that the landscape has a long history of botanical research that dates back to the 1840s and progressed remarkably after the 1980s. Most of the studies have been carried out in India, followed by Nepal and Bhutan. The majority of these have been vegetation surveys, followed by research on ethnobotanical aspects and Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs). This paper describes the forest types and characteristic species of the KL and details the species richness, diversity and dominant families of seed plants. A total of 5198 species of seed plants belonging to 1548 genera and 216 families have been recorded from the landscape, including 3860 dicots, 1315 monocots and 23 gymnosperms. Among families, Orchidaceae is the most diversely represented family in terms of species richness. This paper also draws attention to the threatened and endemic flora of the KL, including 44 species that are threatened at national and global level and 182 species that are endemic. Finally, the paper reviews the major challenges facing the KL, the conservation efforts and practices that are currently in place and recommends systematic and comprehensive floral surveys, particularly long-term data collection and monitoring and transboundary collaboration, to address the existing knowledge gaps on floral diversity of the KL.

The Kashmir region is rich in gymnosperm diversity, which forms an important component, floristically, ecologically and socio-economically: it is known as the green gold of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Gymnosperms harbour a rich diversity of flora and fauna under their canopies. They are the rich source of diverse economic and medicinal products, providing innumerable products, including timber, fuel, gums, resins, medicines and many more useful products, besides acting as effective wind-breaks, especially the evergreen species, which also slow soil erosion and protect watersheds. The single giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), the state tree of California, which grows at Yarikhah Drug Farm (Tangmarg) in Kashmir Valley is the lone representative in the India subcontinent. Due to their immense importance, the gymnosperms have been overexploited by the human population. Sustainable management and conservation of these gymnosperms is urgently required.

The study reports that above ground phytomass varied from 6.13 t/ha to 389.166 t/ha while AGB phytomass estimated using area-weights for sites of 250x250 m, ranged from 5.534 t/ha to 134.082 t/ha. The contribution of bamboo in AGB has been found very high. The analysis indicated that the highest correlation between AGB phytomass and red band (R) of MODIS satellite data of October was (R-2=0.7823) and R-2=0.6998 with both NDVI of October data as well as NDVImax. High correlation (R-2=0.402) with IR band of February month was also found. The phytomass range obtained by using MODIS data varies from 0.147 t/ha to 182.16 t/ha. The mean biomass is 40.50 t/ha.

A total of 61,906 individuals (>= 10 cm gbh) comprising 400 plant species from 254 genera and 75 families were recorded. Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, Lauraceae and Moraceae families constituted 23.5 percent of the total number of species encountered. The relative dominance of species was skewed with Poecilonueron indicum, Xylia xylocarpa, Terminalia tomentosa and Anogeissus latifolia being dominant in some plots. Correspondence analysis (CA) and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of plots by species abundances data showed similar arching patterns, with significant correlation between the first axis of CA and NMDS (r=0.77). Hierarchical clustering of plot scores along the three first CA axes resulted in splitting the plots into five different categories that broadly reflect the major bioclimatic features of the region. A multiscale bootstrapping test indicated that categorization of the wettest (wet evergreen group 1 and 2) and driest (dry deciduous) groups were robust (P < 0.05 with 1000 bootstraps), while the remaining two transitional groups were uncertain (P=0.12 and 0.26 for moist deciduous and semi-evergreen group, respectively). Principal component analysis revealed that plots with similar floristic composition can encompass contrastingly different physiognomic structures (canopy cover, canopy height and mean tree diameter) probably in relation to their levels of disturbance. Observed patterns in the floristic composition have been discussed in the light of the complex interaction between the bioclimatic and disturbance regimes that characterize the region.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00621.x,2010,BIOTROPICA,"Ramesh, BR; Venugopal, PD; Pelissier, R; Patil, SV; Swaminath, MH; Couteron, P",,,Pongamia pinnata; AFLP; molecular diversity; biofuel; polymorphism,JATROPHA-CURCAS; RAPD MARKERS; BIODIESEL; CULTIVARS; GERMPLASM; ISSR; IDENTIFICATION; RFLPS; PLANT; SSRS,CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Osmania University; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"[Thudi, Mahendar; Manthena, Revathi; Wani, Suhas P.; Tatikonda, Leela; Hoisington, David A.; Varshney, Rajeev K.] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Greater Hyderabad 502324, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Tatikonda, Leela] Osmania Univ, Greater Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Varshney, Rajeev K.] CIMMYT, GCP, Genom Gene Discovery Subprogramme, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico","Varshney, RK (corresponding author), Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Greater Hyderabad 502324, Andhra Pradesh, India.","Department of Biotechnology, Government of India",Green Accepted,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear if the commonly used fixed area plot is most efficient for sampling such landscapes, or if a different method could provide equivalent data with less effort. Thus, a field and simulation-based study was carried out to compare the efficiency and accuracy of a variable area transect versus the fixed area square plot. Field efficiency tests were carried out in three habitat types, robusta coffee plantations, arabica coffee plantations and a privately owned forest fragment, in Kodagu, southern India. A simulation study of bias, precision and accuracy of the two methods for tree density estimation also was carried out using various spatial distribution patterns and densities. The variable area transect was significantly more efficient per unit effort in the field than the fixed area square plot. In the simulation tests both methods performed equally well under random spatial distribution. However, under simulated aggregated distribution both methods were positively biased (square plot up to 12% at low density, variable area transect 9-12% at all densities), and under simulated regular distribution the variable area transect was slightly negatively biased (-5 to -7% at medium to high density). The variable area transect thus can be recommended over the square plot for rapid assessment of tree diversity and density, when the vegetation is expected to be randomly dispersed.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10457-009-9255-5,2010,AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS,"Nath, CD; Pelissier, R; Garcia, C",,,community composition; grass; herbivory; large-carnivore conservation; species richness; tree seedling; ungulate; tiger habitat,LANTANA-CAMARA L.; SEEDLING SURVIVAL; DECIDUOUS FOREST; TREE; ECOSYSTEM; GROWTH; EDGE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; SHADE,,"[Prasad, Ayesha E.] Nat Conservat Fdn, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India","Prasad, AE (corresponding author), SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm & Forest Biol, 1 Forestry Dr, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA.",Save the Tiger Fund (NFWF) (U.S.A.); Rufford Foundation for Nature Conservation (U.K.),,,,,,,,,,

The current study has been undertaken in the north eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The population, phytosociological status of its habitat, regeneration and species association of H. aromatica were worked out using standard ecological methods. Out of the 15 selected forest sites for survey, H. aromatica was found only in 9 sites. A total of 288 species representing 99 families are documented from the selected sites where Euphorbiaceae, Meliaceae, Araceae, Dipterocarpaceae and Poaceae are found dominant in all the 9 sites. Species diversity index (H') of all the three habits i.e. the tree, shrub, and herb were found highest in Happy Valley site followed by Ganga Lake. A total of 219 individuals of H. aromatica recorded which were found confined within the altitudinal ranges of 350m-450m asl. The IVI (1.95 to 9.64) and Frequency % (5 to 12.5) range of H. aromatica found significantly low at all the survey sites. Pearson's correlation analysis reveals that there is a positive relationship between the population size and the species diversity index, where shrub showed the strongest relationship (r(7)=0.900, P=0.001) followed by tree r(7)=0.736, P=0.024 and the herbs with weakest relationship (r(7)=0.39, P=0.269). The Chi-square test of association indicated significant association of 10 species with H. aromatica in the various sites where Alocasia acuminate (Aracaceae), Amomum sp.

The present study estimates the biomass and carbon stock of major tropical forest types in India, and attempts to identify suitable interpolation techniques for mapping carbon stock. Empirically derived allometric equations and carbon conversion coefficients were used to estimate the aboveground biomass and carbon stock, respectively. The point estimates were interpolated to spatial surface using different interpolation techniques. Two main modelling approaches were implemented: deterministic modelling and stochastic modelling. Deterministic modelling was to interpolate point information using similarities between measured points (inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation), and fitting a smoothing curve along the measured points (polynomial interpolation). In stochastic modelling, ordinary kriging (OK) was employed using parameters derived from semivariograms. The results showed that the average carbon stock in the study area was 84t/ha. The highest carbon stock was in evergreen forest and the lowest in thorny scrub forest. Validation of the model using the mean and RMS errors indicated that ordinary kriging performs better than IDW and polynomial interpolations.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2010.516107,2010,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY,"Joseph, S; Reddy, CS; Thomas, AP; Srivastava, SK; Srivastava, VK",,,conservation status; community dependence; hydropower potential; forest type; environmental impacts; submergence zone; Western Himalaya,CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; FORESTS; MOUNTAINS; TANZANIA; PLANT,G.B.

This is especially true of lesser known urban spaces such as sacred sites, which are of important cultural and biodiversity significance. We examine tree diversity and composition in sacred sites in Bengaluru, one of India's fastest growing cities. We recorded 5504 trees from 93 species across 62 temples, churches, and Hindu, Christian and Muslim cemeteries in central areas of Bengaluru. Over half (52%) of the tree species were of native origin, a much higher proportion when compared to other green spaces in the city such as parks. Tree density in sacred sites was much higher than that in parks and informal settlements in Bengaluru. Temples and Hindu cemeteries contained the highest proportion of native species, with large numbers of Ficus benghalensis, a keystone sacred species.

Disturbance resulted in considerable increase in air temperature and light intensity in the forest and decline in the soil nutrients concentration, which affected the growth of microbial populations and soil microbial biomass. There were significant correlations between bacterial and fungal populations and microbial biomass C, N and P. Soil microbial population was higher in the undisturbed (UD) forest stand than the disturbed forest stands during post-monsoon and less during rainy season due to heavy rainfall. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and therefore, low microbial biomass C, N and P. Microbial biomass was negatively correlated with soil temperature and pH in all the forest stands. However, there were significant positive relationships among microbial biomass C, N and P. Percentage contribution of microbial C to soil organic C was higher in UD forest, whereas percentage contribution of microbial biomass N and P to total N and total P was higher in the moderately disturbed site than in the highly disturbed (HD) site. These results reveal that the nutrient retention by soil microbial biomass was greater in the selective logged stand and would help in the regeneration of the forest upon protection. On the other hand, the cultivated site (HD) that had the lowest labile fractions of soil organic matter may recover at a slower phase. Further, minimum and maximum microbial biomass C, N and P during rainy and winter seasons suggest the synchronization between nutrient demand for plant growth and nutrient retention in microbial biomass that would help in ecosystem recovery following disturbance.

,,,A2319,60,2320,Fauna data integration and species distribution modelling as two major advantages of geoinformatics-based phytobiodiversity study in today's fast changing climate,"The development and growth of geospatial techniques offer many advantages and challenges to the study of biodiversity, especially in the present era of climate change. We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24% increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2,2012,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Matin, S; Chitale, VS; Behera, MD; Mishra, B; Roy, PS",,,Biodiversity characterization; landscape analysis; remote sensing; spatial database,IDENTIFICATION; MODEL,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Roy, P.

West coast of India host 29% of the mangrove ecosystems of the country. Putting aside the few scientific studies about the Indian mangroves system, there exist gaps in our scientific knowledge of Blue Carbon domain. This study aims to quantify the ecosystem carbon stocks potential and community structure of mangrove vegetation/ ecosystem species of Vypin– Cochin, a coastal region of the Southwest coast of India. The information on species-specific carbon storage will benefit to choose best species in the afforestation and conservation initiatives. Distribution, community structure and carbon pools of above and below ground biomass of the study area were assessed. From the analysis, it is evident that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves varies according to species, functional attributes (basal area, DBH, mean height etc.) and region. Avicennia officinalis, Rhizophora mucronata, Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Bruguiera cylindrica and Sonneratia caseolaris are the mangrove species observed from the study area. As per the community structure assessment, A. officinalis showed large number, frequency, density, and evenness. While considering biomass, R.mucronata species possess high value. The mean overall above ground biomass of the region was 69.55 ± 80.38 t ha−1. Ecosystem carbon stock of the area ranges from 17.7–138.8 with an average of 54.3 ± 36 t ha−1. Therefore, the findings described will serve as a baseline on carbon stock and mangrove stand structure of the region and their role in Blue Carbon dynamics of the Southwest Coast of India.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01365-7,2020,WETLANDS,"ShyleshChandran, MS; Ravi, A; John, SM; Sivan, S; Asha, MS; Mammen, PC; Kumar, KJS; Sruthi, SN",,,Salt marshes; India; Zonation; Density; Wetland; Conservation,PORTERESIA-COARCTATA; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; MANGROVE; COAST; DIVERSITY; GRASS; MANAGEMENT; HALOPHYTE; DISTRICT; RESTORATION,Anna University,"[Viswanathan, C.; Purvaja, R.; Jeevamani, J.

Measurement of canopy cover, light interception and disturbance index revealed that these two sacred forests are comparable with respect to plant diversity and community attributes. The disturbance index was slightly higher in Mairang sacred forests, which had supported high species richness, better recruitment of seedlings leading to high regeneration potential. This was due to formation of gaps within forest. On other hand, gaps facilitated expansion of crown of trees, which inhibited growth and survival of saplings, the retarded growth of saplings had resulted in low conversion of saplings to trees. This condition could also be a reason for high basal area and low tree density in Mairang sacred forest. Endemic, rare and rare endemics were also reported from both the forests. Altitude had impacted composition, and dominance of species and families. Both the forests were highly dissimilar with respect to species composition. Contagious distribution was prevalent in both the forests, clumping is a characteristic feature of natural forest in tropical and subtropical region.

Unfortunately they are often undervalued due to lack of public awareness or resources. Analysis of species diversity and turnover at long-lived gardens can improve the understanding of long-term plant resilience and help adapt management actions to align with rapidly changing urban contexts. Given the various threats faced by urban botanical gardens, we examined tree species diversity, historical changes and survival of plants at the Botanical Garden in Pondicherry (BGP), southern India, which was established 192 years ago by the colonial French government. A complete census of trees was carried out to compare current species diversity with two historical lists compiled 151 years ago and 57 years ago, respectively. These lists were also used to identify heritage trees. Effects of environmental threats, including the very severe cyclonic storm Thane (December 2011) and various damages to young stems, were analysed with Google Earth images and field inventories. There were 284 identified tree species, including 25 endangered/vulnerable/threatened species and 53 tropical dry evergreen forest species. Turnover had occurred, and approximately half of the historical species had been replaced with new species. Tropical Cyclone Thane caused severe damage to large trees and anthropogenic activities damaged saplings. Yet, at least 65 large resilient individuals had survived all the threats, and signifiy the adaptability and heritage value of the BGP. Our study revealed multiple values of this heritage green space in a rapidly developing South Asian city and suggests strategies for modernisation that are aligned with international conservation guidelines. We recommend better monitoring and utilisation of cyclone-damage data to guide future plant introductions at this coastal site.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.02.004,2018,URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING,"Nath, CD; Aravajy, S; Razasekaran, D; Muthusankar, G",,,"Lipoproteins (HDL-C, HDL-TG, LDL-C, LDL-TG, VLDL-C, VLDL-TG); Apolipoproteins (ApoA1, ApoB100); Metabolic syndrome (MetS); Carotid plaque (CP)",INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; TRIGLYCERIDE-RICH LIPOPROTEINS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; RISK; PRECIPITATION; SUBFRACTIONS,Universite Abou Bekr Belkaid; Universite d'Oran; Universite Abou Bekr Belkaid,"[Abi-Ayad, Meryem] Tlemcen Univ, Biol Dept, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Abbou, Amine] Tlemcen Hosp Algeria, Cardiol Dept, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Abi-Ayad, Fatima Zahra] Oran Univ, Biol Dept, Oran, Algeria; [Behadada, Omar] Tlemcen Univ, Biomed Engn Dept, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Benyoucef, Mohamed] Tlemcen Hosp, Biochem Dept, Tilimsen, Algeria","Abi-Ayad, M (corresponding author), Tlemcen Univ, Biol Dept, Tilimsen, Algeria.",,,,,,,,,,,

LocationTropical evergreen forests, Western Ghats, South India. MethodsUsing a plot-based species inventory spanning the entire latitudinal extent (1,200km) of the Western Ghats' wet evergreen forests, we collected primary data on spatial variation in species composition of woody plants. Each plot was characterized by a set of environmental descriptors consisting of topographic, edaphic and climatic variables, while eigenvector-based spatial variables and plot coordinates were used as spatial descriptors. We used ordination-based as well as distance-based variation partitioning techniques to partition the variation in species composition into components uniquely and jointly explained by environmental and spatial factors. ResultsThe compositional similarity of woody plants largely showed a linear decline with log-geographic distance. However, this relationship was spatially structured. After controlling for the differences in environment, compositional similarity was found to be strongly associated with geographic distance only at the smallest spatial scale. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental variables explained a much larger proportion of variation in species composition overall compared to spatial variables. Among environmental variables, climatic variables emerged as the most important predictors of variation in species composition at regional and landscape scales. ConclusionsStrong association between compositional similarity and geographic distance at local scales indicates the influence of dispersal limitation, while niche differentiation seems to be a more important driver of variation in species composition at larger spatial scales. Overall, our results provide evidence for scale-dependent shifts in the relative importance of factors that are responsible for variation in species composition.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12586,2018,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Page, NV; Shanker, K",,,agroforestry; charcoal; ecological history; fossil pollen; India; mixed-modelling; tropical forest,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; LAND-USE; FOREST FRAGMENTS; SACRED GROVES; AGRICULTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; LEGACIES; SYSTEMS; RECORDS,"University of Southampton; University of Oxford; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Open University - UK; Open University - UK; University of Oxford; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier","[Nogue, Sandra] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Nogue, Sandra; Tovar, Carolina; Willis, Kathy J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Tovar, Carolina; Willis, Kathy J.] Kew, Royal Bot Gardens, Richmond TW9 3AE, Surrey, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, Dept Geog, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Open Univ, Open Space Res Ctr, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England; [Bhagwat, Shonil A.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Finsinger, Walter] Univ Montpellier, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS, UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France","Nogue, S (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.;Nogue, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Long Term Ecol Lab, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.",Leverhulme Trust [F/08 773/E]; British Ecological Society; Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters through the VISTA programme [6158],"Green Published, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,,,,,,,

Although they are identified primarily for spiritual or religious purposes, their contribution to biodiversity conservation has been widely debated. Sacred sites are known to harbour greater biodiversity compared to exploited forests, but the patterns are not well known. We studied tree diversity in a remote forested location in eastern India where sacred forests and reserve forests used by people are present. Tree data from eight sacred forest sites and nine reserve forest sites showed that species richness was significantly greater in sacred forests; species diversity and evenness tended to be greater, but these were not statistically significant. Basal area (a measure of aboveground biomass) was significantly greater, mainly due to the greater density of large trees. There were significant departures from the theoretical expectation of stem size density distributions under pure asymmetric competition for both land tenures, which indicated that extraneous mortality increased death rates of large trees under both regimes, but sacred forests had a greater range of stem sizes. Our results suggest that sacred forests can contribute to biodiversity conservation by preserving greater tree diversity than forests subject to human use.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892919000390,2020,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Rath, S; Banerjee, S; John, R",,,Mycobacterium tuberculosis; India; Spoligotype; Strain diversity,GENETIC DIVERSITY; DRUG-RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; BEIJING GENOTYPE; MIRU-VNTR; STRAINS; DELHI; LINEAGES; POLYMORPHISM,Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT); University of Cambridge,"[Poonawala, Husain] Natl Inst Res TB, 1 Mayor Sathyamoorthy Rd, Chennai 600031, Tamil Nadu, India; [Poonawala, Husain] Inst Publ Hlth, Bangalore 560070, Karnataka, India; [Kumar, Narender; Peacock, Sharon J.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Med, Hills Rd, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, England; [Poonawala, Husain] Lowell Gen Hosp, 295 Varnum Ave, Lowell, MA 02446 USA","Poonawala, H (corresponding author), Natl Inst Res TB, 1 Mayor Sathyamoorthy Rd, Chennai 600031, Tamil Nadu, India.","MRC-DBT [MR/N501864/1]; National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, Chennai [BT/IN/DBT-MRC (UK)/12/SS/2015-2016]; Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi; MRC [MR/N501864/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Green Submitted,,,,,,,,,

The present study focuses on investigating the potential use of a one time, QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR L-band 25 m data to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) using a water cloud model (WCM) in a wildlife sanctuary in India. A significant correlation was obtained between the SAR-derived backscatter coefficient (sigma degrees) and the field measured AGB, with the maximum coefficient of determination for cross-polarized (HV) sigma degrees for Shorea robusta, and the weakest correlation was observed with co-polarized (HH) sigma degrees for Tectona grandis forests. The biomass of S. robusta and that of T. grandis were estimated on the basis of field-measured data at 444.7 +/- 170.4 Mg/ha and 451 +/- 179.4 Mg/ha respectively. The mean biomass values estimated using the WCM varied between 562 and 660 Mg/ha for S. robusta; between 590 and 710 Mg/ha for T. grandis using various polarized data.

,,,A1491,73,1492,Patterns of tree-liana interactions: distribution and host preference of lianas in a tropical dry evergreen forest in India,"Lianas are structurally dependent life-form that rely mostly on trees to access the forest canopy. The complex interactions between lianas and trees are often effected by host species' traits. Lianas are evolved with various climbing mechanisms that aid them attach and infest the host trees. Liana infestation on trees now seems to be common in many tropical forests, where they are abundant. The present study was aimed to investigate the patterns of liana-tree interactions in tropical dry evergreen forest of Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary (PCWS), southeast India. This study also analyzes the impact of various tree functional traits on liana colonization success in the PCWS. All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height (gbh) was measured along with lianas (>= 1 cm diameter at 1.3 m from the rooting point) they hosted. Overall, 57.9% of trees in the study sites carried at least one liana. The infested trees hosted an average of 1.53 +/- 0.49 (range; 0-8) lianas per tree. At PCWS, the trees with medium girth-class, moderate wood specific density, rough bark and those with pronounced summer leaflessness are more prone to be infested by lianas. The preference of lianas under different climbing mechanisms in selecting host trees remained similar, although their proportion differed slightly in the present study. Liana infestation on host trees can be highly dynamic under the current scenario of increasing liana abundance and biomass in tropical forests world over for which, we recommend the need for documenting the patterns of tree-liana interactions, by employing a standard protocol to facilitate global comparisons.",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),2017,TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Vivek, P; Parthasarathy, N",,,,SOIL-QUALITY; NUTRITIONAL QUALITY; ORGANIC-CARBON; USE EFFICIENCY; ECONOMICS; ROTATION; TILLAGE; INDEXES; SYSTEMS,Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"[Batabyal, K.; Mandal, B.; Sarkar, D.; Murmu, S.] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India","Batabyal, K (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2101,74,2102,POLINSAR COHERENCE-BASED REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF FOREST BIOMASS USING RADARSAT-2 DATASETS,"Forests play a pivotal role in synchronizing earth's carbon cycle by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in the form of biomass. Researchers today are trying to understand the climatic variations, especially those occurring due to destruction of forest and its corresponding biomass loss. Hence, quantification of various forest parameters such as biomass is imperative for evaluating the carbon. The objective of this research was to exploit the potential of C-band Radarsat-2 Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) technique for analysing the relationship between complex coherence and field-estimated aboveground biomass. Association between the backscatter and the aboveground biomass was also established in the process. To serve our objective, Radarsat-2 interferometric pair dated 4th March, 2013(master image) and 28th March, 2013 (slave image) were procured for the Barkot Reserve Forest region of Dehradun, India. Field sampling was done for 30 plots (31.62m x 31.62m) and stem diameter and tree height were measured in each plot. The study emphasized on the application of POLINSAR coherence instead of using conventional method of relying on backscatter values for retrieving forest biomass. Coherence matrices were utilized for generating complex coherence values for different polarization channels and were regressed against field estimated aboveground biomass. Results indicated a negative linear relationship between complex coherence and aboveground biomass with the cross - polarized coherence showing the highest R-2 value of 0.71. Further, the backscatter mechanism when studied with respect to aboveground biomass indicated a positive linear relationship between backscatter values and field estimated aboveground biomass with R-2 value of 0.45 and 0.61 for slave and master image respectively. The results suggest that PolInSAR technique, in combination with different modelling approaches, can be adopted for estimating forest biomass.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-8-631-2014,2014,ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM,"Singh, J; Kumar, S; Kushwaha, SPS",,,Deforestation; Fragmentation; Conservation; Remote sensing; GIS; Eastern Ghats; India,COVER CHANGES; GROSS,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Reddy, C.

,,,A2935,75,2936,Biodiversity assessment of trees in five inland tropical dry evergreen forests of peninsular India,"A biodiversity inventory of trees was carried out in five hitherto understudied inland tropical dry evergreen forests of peninsular India, by establishing a 1-ha permanent plot in each (Araiyapatti-AP, Karisakkadu-KK, Maramadakki-MM, Shanmuganathapuram-SP and Rayapatti-RP). These sites are also sacred groves and forest fragments experiencing various levels of human disturbance and can be classified as relatively undisturbed (AP), moderately disturbed (KR, SP and RP) or highly disturbed (MM). Site disturbances were categorized based on forest encroachment, temple visitors' impact, resource extraction and the degree of cattle and goat browsing. All trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height in the five plots were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. A total of 60 tree species belonging to 49 genera and 26 families were recorded. Tree species richness was as low as 19 species per hectare in the moderately disturbed site RP to as high as 35 species in the relatively undisturbed site AP. Tree density ranged from 596 stems per hectare in site KR to 1663 trees in site SP and that of basal area from 12.4 m(2) (in RP) to 22.1 m(2) per hectare (in SP). Three species Memecylon umbellatum, Chloroxylon swietenia and Pterospermum conescens scored high importance value index. The Rubiaceae, Mimosaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rutaceae and Sapindaceae constituted the most-speciose families. Among the five sites, SP exemplified a mono-specific dominant tropical forest, with Memecylon umbellatum occupying 69% of the total forest stand density. In all five sites tree species richness and density decreased with increasing girth class. The stand structure of forest sites displayed a reverse J-shaped curve with the exception of site KR. Spatial patterns of trees in the five sites revealed that the individuals of most species are clumped at the 1-ha scale. The non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, based on species richness, diversity indices, stand density, basal area, species population density and disturbance scores, organized the sites into three clusters, chiefly influenced by three variables-species richness, density of predominant species and site disturbance score. In the light of the extant biodiversity, forest fragmentation coupled with human disturbance, and also the cultural tradition associated with the local people, the need for conservation of the sites is emphasized.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1477200004001604,2005,SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY,"Mani, S; Parthasarathy, N",,,,TANDEM REPEAT LOCI; TRIBAL POPULATIONS; GENOMIC DIVERSITY; ANDHRA-PRADESH; INDIAN CASTE; STR LOCI; POLYMORPHISM; ORIGINS; MITOCHONDRIAL; HAPLOTYPES,,"Natl DNA Anal Ctr, Cent Forens Sci Lab, Kolkata 700014, India","Sahoo, S (corresponding author), Natl DNA Anal Ctr, Cent Forens Sci Lab, 30 Gorachand Rd, Kolkata 700014, India.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in north-western Himalaya: Implications of different forest management regimes,"Sustainable forest management is the key to biodiversity conservation, flow of resources and climate change mitigation. We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) and minimum in CSF (90.28Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ).

The plant biodiversity and population structure of woody plants (> 20 cm girth at breast height; gbh) in two such groves, Oorani and Olagapuram, occurring on the north-west of Pondicherry have been analyzed. A total of 169 angiosperms have been enumerated from both sites.

The Olagapuram grove (2.8 ha) was more species-rich with 136 species in 121 genera of 58 families; woody species were fewer (21) while 9 lianas and 3 parasites occurred. The vegetation structure indicates that the Oorani grove is a relic of tropical dry evergreen forest, whereas Olagapuram is reduced to a thorny woodland. The latter is heavily degraded as it has lost the status of a sacred grove because of its conversion to Eucalyptus plantations. The Oorani grove has an Amman temple in the centre.

,,,A1317,80,1318,Functional trait and community phylogenetic analyses reveal environmental filtering as the major determinant of assembly of tropical forest tree communities in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India,"Background: Improved understanding of the processes shaping the assembly of tropical tree communities is crucial for gaining insights into the evolution of forest communities and biological diversity. The climate is thought to be the first order determinant of abundance and distribution patterns of tree species with contrasting traits such as evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. However, the relative role of neutral, and niche-based processes in the evolution of these patterns remain poorly understood. Methods: Here, we perform an integrated analysis of the data on tree species abundance, functional traits and community phylogeny from a network of 96 forest plots, each 1 ha in size, distributed along a broad environmental gradient in the central Western Ghats, India. Then, we determine the relative importance of various process in assembly and structuring of tropical forest communities with evergreen and deciduous leaf phenology. Results: The deciduous leaf phenological trait has repeatedly evolved among multiple distantly related lineages. Tree communities in dry deciduous forests were phylogenetically clustered and showed a low range and variance of functional traits related to light harvesting, reproduction, and growth suggesting niche-based processes such as environmental filtering play a vital role in the assembly of tree communities in these forests. The external factors such as human-mediated disturbance also significantly, but to a lesser extent, influences the species and phylogenetic turnover.

A total of 610 000 stems were identified to species and mapped to < Im accuracy. Mean species number and stem number were calculated in quadrats as small as 5 m x 5 m to as large as 1000 m x 500 m, for a variety of stem sizes above 10 mm in diameter. Species-area curves were generated by plotting species number as a function of quadrat size; species-individual curves were generated from the same data, but using stem number as the independent variable rather than area. 2 Species-area curves had different forms for stems of different diameters, but species-individual curves were nearly independent of diameter class. With < 10(4) stems, species-individual curves were concave downward on log-log plots, with curves from different forests diverging, but beyond about 104 stems, the log-log curves became nearly linear, with all three sites having a similar slope. This indicates an asymptotic difference in richness between forests: the Malaysian site had 2.7 times as many species as Panama, which in turn was 3.3 times as rich as India. 3 Other details of the species-accumulation relationship were remarkably similar between the three sites. Rectangular quadrats had 5-27% more species than square quadrats of the same area, with longer and narrower quadrats increasingly diverse. Random samples of stems drawn from the entire 50 ha had 10-30% more species than square quadrats with the same number of stems. At both Pasoh and BCI, but not Mudumalai. species richness was slightly higher among intermediate-sized stems (50-100mm in diameter) than in either smaller or larger sizes, These patterns reflect aggregated distributions of individual species, plus weak density-dependent forces that tend to smooth the species abundance distribution and 'loosen' aggregations as stems grow. 4 The results provide support for the view that within each tree community, many species have their abundance and distribution guided more by random drift than deterministic interactions. The drift model predicts that the species-accumulation curve will have a declining slope on a log-log plot, reaching a slope of O.1 in about 50 ha. No other model of community structure can make such a precise prediction. 5 The results demonstrate that diversity studies based on different stem diameters can be compared by sampling identical numbers of stems. Moreover, they indicate that stem counts < 1000 in tropical forests will underestimate the percentage difference in species richness between two diverse sites. Fortunately, standard diversity indices (Fisher's sc, Shannon-Wiener) captured diversity differences in small stem samples more effectively than raw species richness, but both were sample size dependent. Two nonparametric richness estimators (Chao. jackknife) performed poorly, greatly underestimating true species richness.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.2307/2261477,1996,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"Condit, R; Hubbell, SP; Lafrankie, JV; Sukumar, R; Manokaran, N; Foster, RB; Ashton, PS",,Mudumalai 50ha plot,microbial biomass; soil nutrient pool; forest regrowth,SOIL BIOMASS; NITROGEN; MINERALIZATION; PHOSPHORUS; FUMIGATION; PASTURE; CARBON; RANGE,North Eastern Hill University,"NE HILL UNIV,DEPT BOT,PLANT ECOL DEPT,SHILLONG 793022,MEGHALAYA,INDIA",,,,,,,,,,,,

Field assessments were conducted on 6 predominant land uses including (a) natural forest (NF), (b) degraded forest (DF), (c) rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation (RP), (d) Areca (Areca catechu) plantation (ArP), (e) pan (Piper betle) jhum (slash and mulching) agroforestry (PB), and (f) Imperata grassland (IG) of Northeast India to assess changes in ecosystem C stock with progressive and retrogressive LUC. Ecosystem C stock was the highest for NF (300.5Mg ha(-1)) and the lowest under IG (110.4Mg ha(-1)). The ecosystem C stock under PB and IG was 11% and 63%, respectively, lower than that under NF. In comparison with DF, the gain in ecosystem C was in the order PB (125%)>RP (99%)>ArP (4%). The ratio of soil organic carbon to ecosystem C stock was similar to 50% for NF, PB, and RP and that shifted to similar to 80% for ArP/DF/IG. The LUC and management of DF through PB and RP indicated the ecosystem C sequestration rate of 5 and 4Mg ha(-1)year(-1), respectively. Similarly, the ecosystem C sequestration rate was 0.5 and 4Mg ha(-1)year(-1), respectively, when IG was converted into ArP and RP. Therefore, restoration of degraded lands (viz., DF and IG) through RP and PB enhanced ecosystem C sequestration rate and reduced CO2 emissions from LUC.

This heterogeneity may be governing plant species assemblages, diversity, and dominance patterns in the riparian habitats of the lentic systems in tropical floodplains. We tested this hypothesis in the floodplains of Barak river basin in northeast India following standard methods of plant and soil sampling/analysis and multivariate statistical tools. Plant community studies in the riparian habitats of the selected lentic systems were done at monthly intervals for a period of one year, while soil sampling and analysis were done at bimonthly intervals. Standard data visualization plots and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to assess spatiotemporal variations in species richness and diversity, environmental heterogeneity, and species-environment association. The study revealed that anthropogenic land use and land cover significantly affects species assemblage, diversity, and dominance in the riparian habitats. The variations in vegetation structure and composition with respect to the adjoining land use type plausibly have implications on the structure and functioning of the lentic systems. Thus, the study recommends that a holistic approach involving the riparian areas is required for effective management of tropical floodplains. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

,,,A3113,89,3114,"Farmers' attitude towards sustainable management of Soppina Betta forests in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats, South India","Soppina Betta Forests (SBFs; foliage forests) are minor forests allowed by the State for the Areca-grower's use as organic support in the Western Ghats area of Karnataka, South India. Sustainable utilization of these for foliage and litter (to make composted leaf-manure) and firewood (to boil Areca nuts before drying) would ensure the farmer to stand on his own and prevent him from unduly pressurizing the State Forests. Ten hamlets in Sringeri area of the Western Ghats were selected at random, from each of which nearly 10 farmers were interviewed by PRA technique for a socio-economic survey of the purpose, benefits and management of their individual SBFs. One representative SBF from each of the 10 hamlets was taken up for phytosociological survey and the results were compared with a natural forest benchmark selected nearby. Species diversity at all levels was higher in the SBFs than in the natural forest. Stand densities too were higher, but basal coverages were lower. The farmers were found to promote select species like Aporosa lindleyana, Memecylon umbellatum, Syzygium cumini and S. caryophyllatum for their foliage requirements, The benefits derived, lopping patterns, protection and planting attitudes of the farmers were marked with a differentiating scheme and the relative scores on these four heads of management attributes were summed up into a management value index (MVI). MVI was found to increase with the Areca-landholding status of the farmers, and optimization of the MVI was observed at an Areca-landholding to SBF ratio of 1 : 1.5-2.5 for the low (0-1 ha), intermediate (1-2 ha) and rich (>2 ha) Areca-landholding categories. The optimization was most pronounced for the low landholding group of farmers. The average size-class distribution of tree species individuals of the 10 SBFs described the expected L-shaped curve similar to that of the natural forest, but possessed larger number of individuals in most of the size-classes.

Fifteen villages dominated by tribal communities, under five Community Development Blocks were selected. A semi structured questionnaire was developed to bring together data on traditional crops and forest species still used by the communities. The methodology engaged was personal discussions with mixed focused groups combined with field visits, photographs, voice recordings and collection of materials. Findings were that tribal communities cultivate a diverse crop species with varying durations to meet their food and economic requirement throughout the year. This was supplemented by wild food collections during scarcity periods. Various forest species provide wood, fibre, leaves and grasses for agriculture, house construction and specific uses besides enhancing household income. Tribal health care practitioners collect medicinal plants from the wild and semi wild to treat both humans and livestock. At the end of the study the team assumed that tribal communities would continue to depend on traditional crops and wild forest foods for their household consumption and a diverse species of plants for other specific use. Conservation of these valuable resources in its natural habitat would be an appropriate approach for ensuring food security of future generations. Conventional plant breeders and biotechnologists should undertake scientific validation of these crops and plants to make their value explicitly known. This knowledge could be utilized for crop improvement and bio-prospecting.

,,,A1216,94,1217,Phylogenetic diversity in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot reflects environmental filtering and past niche diversification of trees,"Aim We examined how contrasted climatic conditions influenced the ecological and phylogenetic diversity of tropical trees at the regional scale. Beyond the basic expectation of greater environmental filtering in currently stressful contexts, we addressed how biogeographic history and past climates contributed to shaping the distribution and diversity of extant taxa. Location Evergreen forests of Western Ghats, India. Methods We evaluated the relative importance of niche-based, historical, and spatial processes on community phylogenetic structure and turnover in 297 plots including 459 species. If niche conservatism prevails, we expected greater phylogenetic clustering under harsher or historically less stable climates, and overdispersion in opposite conditions. To test the role of environmental filtering in shaping local communities, we assessed species' climatic niches and congruence between niche and phylogenetic diversity. To assess the imprint of ancient versus recent evolutionary constraints, we calculated mean pair-wise (MPD) and nearest-taxon (MNTD) phylogenetic distances, respectively. Results We found non-random phylogenetic structure depending on both current and past climatic variation. Basal community phylogenetic structure (MPD) was related to niche diversity and varied according to hydric stress: (a) northern environments filtered more closely related species, while (b) phylogenetic overdispersion suggested greater niche differentiation in stable, least-seasonal southern habitats and at high elevations. Terminal phylogenetic structure (MNTD) did not show overdispersion. Phylogenetic turnover was driven by current abiotic factors, not space. Main conclusions The patterns of ecological and phylogenetic diversity likely reflect the Miocene climate shift to increasing seasonality northwards. Phylogenetic clustering under hydric stress or historical instability suggests the influence of functional conservatism, whereas overdispersion in southern forests supports the persistence of old lineages in an ancient rain forest refugium as an evolutionary museum. Overdispersion in fragmented montane forests reflects a mixture of biogeographically distinct species pools, both tropical and temperate, that characterise environmentally contrasted cores and fringes. Low phylogenetic turnover along the seasonality gradient suggests recent ecological diversification across forests with contrasted rainfall seasonality.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13464,2019,JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Bose, R; Ramesh, BR; Pelissier, R; Munoz, F",,,Kaisodi virus; Next-generation sequencing; India; Genomic characterization; Phylogenetic analysis,KYASANUR-FOREST-DISEASE; STATE SOUTH-INDIA; SANDFLY FEVER; MYSORE-STATE; HAEMAPHYSALIS SPINIGERA; MALSOOR VIRUS; PUNTA-TORO; TRANSCRIPTION; BUNYAVIRIDAE; IDENTIFICATION,Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); ICMR - National Institute of Virology (NIV),"[Yadav, P.

,,,A1767,95,1768,Random Forest Regression modelling for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation using RISAT-1 PolSAR and Terrestrial LiDAR Data,"SAR and LiDAR remote sensing have already shown the potential of active sensors for forest parameter retrieval. SAR sensor in its fully polarimetric mode has an advantage to retrieve scattering property of different component of forest structure and LiDAR has the capability to measure structural information with very high accuracy. This study was focused on retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) based point clouds and scattering property of forest vegetation obtained from decomposition modelling of RISAT-1 fully polarimetric SAR data. TLS data was acquired for 14 plots of Timli forest range, Uttarakhand, India. The forest area is dominated by Sal trees and random sampling with plot size of 0.1 ha (31.62m* 31.62m) was adopted for TLS and field data collection. RISAT-1 data was processed to retrieve SAR data based variables and TLS point clouds based 3D imaging was done to retrieve LiDAR based variables. Surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, volume scattering, helix and wire scattering were the SAR based variables retrieved from polarimetric decomposition. Tree heights and stem diameters were used as LiDAR based variables retrieved from single tree vertical height and least square circle fit methods respectively. All the variables obtained for forest plots were used as an input in a machine learning based Random Forest Regression Model, which was developed in this study for forest AGB estimation. Modelled output for forest AGB showed reliable accuracy (RMSE = 27.68 t/ha) and a good coefficient of determination (0.63) was obtained through the linear regression between modelled AGB and field-estimated AGB. The sensitivity analysis showed that the model was more sensitive for the major contributed variables (stem diameter and volume scattering) and these variables were measured from two different remote sensing techniques. This study strongly recommends the integration of SAR and LiDAR data for forest AGB estimation.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2227380,2016,LIDAR REMOTE SENSING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING XV,"Mangla, R; Kumar, S; Nandy, S",,,Lavandula; phylogeny; polyploidy; biogeography; C-value; trnK-matK; plastid marker,PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; LAMIACEAE; LABIATAE,Universite de Rouen Normandie; Universite Jean Monnet; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); VetAgro Sup,"[Moja, S.; Guitton, Y.; Nicole, F.; Jullien, F.] Univ Lyon, F-42023 St Etienne, France; [Moja, S.; Guitton, Y.; Nicole, F.; Jullien, F.] Univ St Etienne, Lab BVpam, EA3061, 23 Rue Dr Paul Michelon, F-42000 St Etienne, France; [Legendre, L.] Univ Lyon, F-69622 Lyon, France; [Legendre, L.] Univ Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France; [Legendre, L.] CNRS, Ecol Microbienne, UMR5557, Villeurbanne, France; [Pasquier, B.] CNPMAI, Route Nemours, F-91490 Milly La Foret, France; [Upson, T.] Cambridge Univ Bot Garden, 1 Brookside, Cambridge CB2 1JF, England","Moja, S (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, F-42023 St Etienne, France.;Moja, S (corresponding author), Univ St Etienne, Lab BVpam, EA3061, 23 Rue Dr Paul Michelon, F-42000 St Etienne, France.",Region Rhone-Alpes (France); Conseil General de l'Essonne,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A1663,103,1664,Plant species richness pattern across India's longest longitudinal extent,"Although the longitudinal pattern of biological diversity may not be as striking as the latitudinal pattern, there are climatic gradients associated with habitat, topography and disturbance, which may generate variation in biological diversity along a longitudinal extent. We analysed the pattern of plant diversity using field data gathered from a national level 'biodiversity characterization at landscape level' project, along the longest longitudinal extent of India, varying from desert to wet tropics. Across a 3 degrees latitudinal band (25-27 degrees N lat.), the aridity decreased drastically from west to east, and the vegetation varied from tropical thorn, tropical deciduous, tropical semi-evergreen to tropical evergreen forests. In general, the species diversity is maximum in the east, minimum in the centre and intermediate in the west. The proportion (with respect to total number of species of each corresponding grid) of woody trees increased by half and shrubs increased by one-third, whereas herbal proportion decreased by half from western to eastern grid. The major predictor of species richness was the number of forest vegetation types, followed by topography (ruggedness index); together these explained 63% of the variance as revealed from generalized linear modelling analysis. The study concludes that, from west to east, (i) the vegetation type varies from tropical thorn to tropical moist/wet evergreen forest corresponding to aridity; (ii) there is monotonic drastic increase of woody tree, moderate increase of shrub, and drastic decrease of herb species, and (iii) plant diversity has a nonlinear distribution pattern attributed mainly to variation in the number of forest vegetation types followed by abiotic topography and climate.

These groves harbour rich biodiversity and play a significant role in the conservation of biodiversity. Population structure and regeneration status of woody species were studied during 2001-2002 in the four sacred groves of Manipur, a state in north east India. A total of 96 woody species was recorded from the four groves, the highest being Konthoujam Lairembi sacred grove (55 species) and lowest in Heingang Marjing sacred grove having 42 species. The density-diameter distribution of woody species in the four groves showed highest stand density and species richness in the lowest girth class (30-60 cm) and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. Overall population structure of the groves based on the number of tree seedlings, saplings and adults, displayed a greater proportion of seedlings followed by saplings and adults while for the selected tree species it varied seasonally and recruitment of species increased during rainy season attaining peak during June. Regeneration status of the four sacred groves based on strength of different age groups in their population showed good regeneration. High occurrence of 'additional species' to the groves may be due to the invasion through dispersal from other areas. Possibly, the prevailing favourable microenvironmental conditions contributed to their establishment and growth in the groves. Absence of seedlings and saplings of some of the species in the groves may be due to their poor seed germination and establishment of seedlings in the forest.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-004-6901-0,2006,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Khumbongmayum, AD; Khan, M; Tripathi, RS",,,sulfur oxidation; chemolithoautotrophic paracocci; Paracoccus bengalensis sp nov.; leguminous rhizosphere,THIOSPHAERA-PANTOTROPHA; GEN.

,,,A1706,105,1707,Seed size predicts community composition and carbon storage potential of tree communities in rain forest fragments in India's Western Ghats,"1. Fragmentation is ubiquitous across tropical forests and drives marked shifts in tree community composition by differentially affecting species' dispersal, establishment and survival. Such compositional shifts can potentially alter ecosystem-level properties such as above-ground carbon storage, but our understanding of the factors linking compositional shifts to carbon storage is limited. 2. We compared tree communities of contiguous and fragmented tropical rain forests in the Western Ghats (India) and assessed the ability of various plant functional traits associated with seed dispersal, establishment and survival processes to predict species' responses to fragmentation. 3. Further, we assessed relationships between functional traits that predict tree community turnover and those that govern carbon storage to examine how fragmentation effects on species' composition can alter the ability of tree communities to store carbon. 4. Seed size, as indexed by seed length, was the best predictor of species' responses, with larger-seeded species declining in fragments. Across species, seed length was positively correlated with maximum attainable height, which decreased by 10% on average at the community level in fragments. Such shifts towards smaller-seeded communities could decrease forest stature and reduce above-ground carbon stocks by 8%. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights a previously undescribed mechanism by which fragmentation-driven declines of large-seeded tree species can reduce above-ground carbon stocks by promoting shorter-statured forests. These results imply that strict protection alone might be insufficient and that a multipronged conservation strategy would be required to sustain carbon stocks in tropical forest fragments. Such interventions will need to combine restoration programmes for large-seeded tree species in fragments with broader-scale efforts to maintain hospitable and well-connected landscapes for their seed dispersers.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12626,2016,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Osuri, AM; Sankaran, M",,,Trees outside forests; High resolution data; Geospatial; Remote sensing,SCALE,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Osmania University; Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Hyderabad","[Pujar, G.

Knowledge on growth rates and ecological impacts of these tree species is limited. Ten locally valued multipurpose tree species, viz., Albizzia lebbek, Alnus nepalensis, Boehmeria rugulosa, Celtis australis, Dalbergia sissoo, Ficus glomerata, Grewia optiva, Prunus cerasoides, Pyrus pashia and Sapium sebiferum, were established as mixed plantations at a degraded community forest land site and an abandoned agricultural land site in a village at 1200 m altitude in District Chamoli, India. At the abandoned agricultural land site, annual food crops were grown, along with planted trees, providing supplemental irrigation and organic manure following traditional farming practices. Survival, height, stem circumference, crown depth and width, number of branches, above-ground biomass and soil physico-chemical characteristics were monitored up to five years of plantation growth. Above-ground tree biomass accumulation at the abandoned agricultural land site was 3.9 t ha(-1) yr(-1) compared with 1.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1) at the degraded forest land site. B. rugulosa, C. australis, F. glomerata, G. optiva, P. cerasoides and S. sebiferum showed more prominent differences in growth at the two sites compared with A. lebbek, A. nepalensis, D. sissoo and P. pashia.

Assessment of carbon stock in forest vegetation is necessary for atmospheric carbon mitigation plans. The present study aimed to assess the total carbon stock in tree vegetation of Kolli hill (KH), a reserve forest located in India. The land area of KH (508 km(2)) was parted by 6.25 x 6.25 km(2) grids. In each grid, a transect of 0.5 ha (5 m x 1000 m) was laid randomly, and all live trees greater than or equal to 30 cm girth (=9.55 cm diameter) measure at breast height were sampled. Carbon stock of each tree was determined by non-destructive method. The carbon stock estimated for KH forest was 73.7 +/- 13.6 tC/ha. Maximum carbon stock was shared by Alseodaphne semicarpifolia var. semecarpifolia (14 %) among 157 species and Lauraceae (19 %) among 49 families recorded at KH. Statistical analysis revealed that the carbon stock values varied significantly among the eleven tree size classes (ANOVA, F-(10,F-187) = 4.439, p<0.001) and among the three major forest types (F-(2,F-15) = 6.101, p<0.05) recognized.

A total of 120 transects (1000 m x 5 m) were laid in Nayagarh, Odogaon, Pancharida, Khandapada, Dasapalla, Mahipur, and Gania forest ranges and tree stems of at least 30 cm GBH were measured. The regeneration potential of trees was assessed from 5 m x 5 m sample plots located within the main transect. A total of 177 tree species belonging to 120 genera and 44 families were recorded from the study area. Shorea robusta, Buchanania lanzan, Lannea coromandelica, Terminalia alata and Cleistanthus collinus were the predominant tree species. The stand density varied in the range of 355.33-740.53 stems ha(-1) while basal area ranged from 7.77 to 31.62 m(2) ha(-1). The tree density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class. The highest number of species and maximum density was recorded in the girth class of 30-60 cm. The Shannon-Weiner and Simpson Indices with respect to trees with ae<yen>30 cm GBH varied in the range of 2.07-3.79 cm and 0.03-0.37 cm respectively and the values of diversity indices are within the reported range for tropical forests of Indian sub-continent. The families, Dipterocarpaceae, Anacardiaceae, Combretaceae and Euphorbiaceae contributed to maximum species richness, stand density, and basal area.

While much is known about these adverse effects on tree communities in tropical moist forests, similar effects in tropical dry forests are little understood. This paper examines the relationship between roads, road-related exotic plant invasion and tree community change in a tropical dry forest in Southern India. Forty pairs of roadside and interior plots across four factorial combinations of road width (wide and narrow) and understorey type (native and exotic) were sampled. Tree death and extant tree community composition were compared using generalized linear models and similarity analyses. Tree death near roads was more than double that away from them, suggesting that roads may increase tree death in these forests. The interactive effect of Understorey type (exotic or native) and road width on tree death was significant, with highest tree death near wide roads bordered by exotic Understorey. Conversely, tree community composition was influenced by road width and understorey type, but not by proximity to roads. Creation and maintenance of roads for forest management may have serious implications for tree communities in tropical dry forests and should thus be minimized. Exotic plants may also be important contributors to increasing tree death, and further research on their impacts, particularly into underlying mechanisms, is critical to the long-term conservation of tropical dry forest communities.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892909990257,2009,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Prasad, AE",,,Carbon sequestration; Carbon credits; Afforestation; Reforestation; Remote sensing,BIOMASS,"Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)","[Kale, Manish P.] Ctr Dev Adv Comp, Pune 411005, Maharashtra, India; [Ravan, Shirish A.] UN OOSA, A-1400 Vienna, Austria; [Roy, P.

On plots of a fixed size, does stem density alone predict number of species? Are differences in density related to disturbance and altitude? Location: Achanakmar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve, central India. Methods: 42 sites, each with three replicate 10-m radius plots, were examined. All trees (>= 30 cm GBH) in each plot were measured for firth at breast height, alpha-diversity, species richness and evenness were calculated for each site. The sites were ordinated by Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) using relative importance values of component species. Correspondence Analysis was used to broadly delineate communities. Anthropogenic disturbances, were recorded in terms of percentage of trees lopped, scale of lopping, number of domestic livestock dung piles and foot trails (both livestock and people) for each plot. Results: The NMS analysis exhibited a near linear arrangement of sites with no evidence of discrete vegetation zones. NMS axes were significantly related to altitude and disturbance scores. With increasing elevation, basal area increased but number of species. alpha-diversity and its components declined monotonically. The number of species and indices of species diversity were positively associated with free lopping and also with total disturbance. Number of species was controlled by stem density only ill plots not dominated by Shorea robusta. Conclusions: Recent levels of human disturbance are associated with higher species diversity in this biosphere reserve. There is some evidence that stands at all altitudes follow the same successional pattern to dominance by Shorea. a successional pattern that also results in decreased diversity without disturbance.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3170/2008-7-18537,2008,APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Sahu, PK; Sagar, R; Singh, JS",,,Canarium strictum; conservation; India; non-timber forest products; resin; Western Ghats,BILIGIRI RANGAN HILLS; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; WESTERN-GHATS; EXTRACTION,University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"[Ticktin, Tamara] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,International Development Research Centre (IDRC); NSF [OISE03-52827],,,,,,,,,,

Among all available remote sensing data and methods, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in combination with decision tree based machine learning algorithms has produced favourable results in estimating higher biomass values. Suitability of this method for dense tropical forests has not been properly checked with an adequate number of studies. In this study, aboveground biomass was estimated for two major tree species, Shorea robusta, and Tectona grandis, of Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary, a tropical forest situated in northern India. Aboveground biomass was estimated by combining C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1A satellite, texture images generated from Sentinel-1A data, vegetation indices produced using Sentinel-2A data and ground inventory plots. Decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used in place of parametric regression models for establishing a relationship between fields measured values and remotely sensed parameters. Using random forest model with a combination of vegetation indices with SAR backscatter as predictor variables shows the best result for S. robusta forest, with a coefficient of determination value of 0.71 and an RMSE value of 105.027 t/ha. In T. grandis forest best result can be found in the same combination but for stochastic gradient boosted model with a coefficient of determination value of 0.6 and an RMSE value of 79.45 t/ha.

The fewest species (11) were seen at a degraded mangrove site near the river mouth, and the greatest number (150) in the rich semi-evergreen forest on Tungar Hill. For all sites there were 141 tree, 25 shrub and 15 liana species, a total of 181 species. Excluding the mangrove site, which had no species in common with the other 14 sites, we analyzed the species distributions in detail. These sites ranged in area from 4 to 30 km(2) each, had woody floras of 89 +/- 6 species, and varied in intensity of human impact. Despite a history of exploitation and substantial reduction in biomass from firewood collecting, set fires and illicit tree felling, considerable plant diversity remains in the area. We found a modest increase in species richness in transects away from two villages. We observed the exploitation of the forest by the principal users, primarily of the Warli Tribe. They exploited a wide variety of forest resources ( 92 species), for medicines, foods, construction materials, household goods, manure and other purposes. They collected 15 items for sale. By far the single most important item collected was firewood, which dramatically reduced forest biomass within 2 km of villages. The species distributions in these forest remnants are strongly nested, mostly due to varying degrees of disturbance at individual sites. The high species diversity on Tungar Hill is most likely a relict of the earlier character of forests throughout much of the valley. It merits the highest priorities for preservation, as a refuge for Western Ghat species at the northern limits of their distributions.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1022834722091,2003,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Veach, R; Lee, D; Philippi, T",,,afforestation; salinity control; saline irrigation; arid soil rehabilitation; salt tolerance; degraded lands; water use; carbon enrichment; irrigated plantations,WATER IRRIGATION; GROWTH,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Soil Salinity Research Institute,"Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, AICRP Management Salt Affected Soils & Use Saline, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India","Minhas, PS (corresponding author), Cent Soil Salin Res Inst, AICRP Management Salt Affected Soils & Use Saline, Karnal 132001, Haryana, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2800,120,2801,Relationship between size hierarchy and density of trees in a tropical dry deciduous forest of western India,"Questions: Density dependence is thought to restrict exponential growth as well as give rise to size structure in populations. Size hierarchy in trees from tropical dry deciduous forests is studied to ask (1) whether nature of competition is symmetric or asymmetric and (2) what is the self thinning trajectory under a natural gradient of tree density. Location: Western India. Methods: Density was measured as the number of trees in 10-m radius circular plots (n = 96) and size was measured at DBH. Size variation was evaluated by the Gini coefficient (n = 1239 trees). Results: Size inequality between neighbours decreased with density but in a non-linear manner. In the backdrop of existing theory this indirectly suggests that competitive interactions may be symmetric over a 'depletive' resource such as below-ground water (rather than a 'pre-emptive' resource such as light), which is very plausible in a semi-arid environment. The self thinning coefficient derived from the relationship between stem diameter and density (y approximate to -1/4), is higher than expected from existing models of allometric plant growth (y approximate to -1/3) which are based on above-ground interactions alone. Seen in conjunction, these results suggest that above-ground structures, such as stem size, do not adequately represent the outcome of competitive interactions when below-ground resources, such as water, may be more important under semi-arid conditions. Conclusions: The non-linear relationship between size inequality and density indicates that there exists a density threshold beyond which investment in above-ground biomass becomes sluggish in semi-arid, deciduous forests. Since current allometric models do not incorporate below-ground biomass for trees, these data suggest that a more comprehensive allometric growth model may have higher predictive power and wider applicability.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2007.tb02551.x,2007,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Bagchi, S",,,anamorphic Clavicipitaceae; epizootic population; Hypocreales; mitochondrial ribosomal genes; parasexual cycle,BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA; METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC-VARIABILITY; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; DIVERSITY; HAPLOTYPES; SPECIATION; PLASMIDS; PATTERNS,Andhra University; Tata Sons; Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS),"Andhra Univ, Dept Bot, Visakhapatnam 003, Andhra Pradesh, India; Geisenheim Res Ctr, Sect Phytomed, D-65366 Geisenheim, Germany; Ctr Adv Technol, Bioinformat Div, Tata Consultancy Serv, Hyderabad 500081, Andhra Pradesh, India","Devi, UK (corresponding author), Andhra Univ, Dept Bot, Visakhapatnam 530, Visakhapatnam 003, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 5-month study on Presbytis entellus in a moist deciduous forest in the Rajaji National Park, Uttar Pradesh, India. The study period covered two seasons, winter and spring. We used the percentage time spent feeding on each food item as an index of food selection, which we estimated from group scan data collected from one study group for 6 days each month. We estimated the selection ratio for each item as the ratio of time spent feeding to availability. We estimated food availability from vegetation sampling and phenological data in the home range of the study group. We estimated crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and tannins in mature and young leaves of 12 major food species in the laboratory. Food selection is positively correlated with CP in winter and negatively correlated with ADF in both seasons. It also is correlated with CP/ADF ratio, but to a lesser extent than the best predictor in winter and spring. Selection ratio is not correlated with CP and ADF in both seasons. It is probable that the inclusion of other factors, such as micronutrients, condensed tannins, and digestibility, might give a better prediction of food selection.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02735235,1994,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,"KARGUPTA, K; KUMAR, A",,,SHIFTING CULTIVATION; JHUMING; REGENERATION; GROUP COMPOSITION; SECONDARY FOREST; FEEDING ECOLOGY,,Wildlife Institute of India,"WILDLIFE INST INDIA, DEHRA DUN 248001, INDIA",,,,,,,,,,,,

The study evaluated community structure, biodiversity, Technosol quality, and carbon (C) dynamics in the post-mining ecosystem (PME). The multivariate statistical tool was used to identify the key soil properties, and soil quality was evaluated byusing Technosol quality index (TQI). One unreclaimed site (0years) and four chronosequences revegetated coal mine sites (3, 7, 10, and 15years) were studied and compared with an undisturbed forest as a reference site. Plant biodiversity indices [Shannon index of diversity (2.42) and Pielou's evenness (0.97) and Patric richness (12)] were highest in 15-year-old revegetated sites. Soil physicochemical and biological properties were recovered with the revegetation age. Soil organic C (SOC) stock significantly increased from 0.75Mg Cha(-1) in 3years to 7.60Mg Cha(-1) after 15years of revegetation in top 15cm of soils. Ecosystem C pool increased at a rate of 5.38Mg Cha(-1)year(-1). Soil CO2 flux was significantly increased from 0.27mol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1) in unreclaimed sites to 3.19mol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1) in 15-year-old revegetated site. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that dehydrogenase activity (DHA), available nitrogen (N), and silt content were the key soil parameters that were affected by reclamation.

For this, we mapped soil (available nutrients, Al, total C, pH, moisture and texture in the top 10cm), rock outcrops, topography, all native woody plants >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (DBH), and spatial variation in fire frequency (times burnt during the 17 years preceding soil sampling) in a permanent 50-ha plot. Unlike classic catenas, lower elevation soils had lesser moisture, plant-available Ca, Cu, Mn, Mg, Zn, B, clay and total C. The distribution of plant-available Ca, Cu, Mn and Mg appeared to largely be determined by the whole-rock chemical composition differences between amphibolites and hornblende-biotite gneisses. Amphibolites were associated with summit positions, while gneisses dominated lower elevations, an observation that concurs with other studies in the region which suggest that hillslope-scale topography has been shaped by differential weathering of lithologies. Neither NO3--N nor NH4+-N was explained by the basal area of trees belonging to Fabaceae, a family associated with N-fixing species, and no long-term effects of fire on soil parameters were detected. Local-scale lithological variation is an important first-order control over soil variability at the hillslope scale in this SDTF, by both direct influence on nutrient stocks and indirect influence via control of local relief.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153212,2016,PLOS ONE,"Pulla, S; Riotte, J; Suresh, HS; Dattaraja, HS; Sukumar, R",,,tea; Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); shade tree; leaf yield,USE EFFICIENCY; LIGHT INTERCEPTION; CANOPY; ULTRAVIOLET; IRRIGATION; BIOMASS; GROWTH; WHEAT; WATER; PRODUCTIVITY,Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University,"[Mukherjee, Asis; Sarkar, S.] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Meteorol & Phys, Mohanpur, India","Mukherjee, A (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Dept Agr Meteorol & Phys, Mohanpur, India.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2489,130,2490,Biodiversity conservation and livelihoods in human-dominated landscapes: Forest commons in South Asia,"Strict protected areas are a critical component in global biodiversity conservation, but the future of biodiversity conservation may well depend upon the ability to experiment successfully with a range of institutional forms, including those that permit human use. Here, we focus on forest commons in human-dominated landscapes and their role in biodiversity conservation at the same time as they provide livelihood benefits to users. Using a dataset of 59 forest commons located in Bhutan, India, and Nepal, we estimated tree species richness from plot vegetation data collected in each forest, and drew on interview data to calculate a livelihoods index indicating the overall contribution of each forest to villager livelihoods for firewood, fodder, and timber. We found that tree species richness and livelihoods were positively and significantly correlated (rho = .41, p < 0.001, N = 59). This relationship held regardless of forest type or country, though significance varied somewhat across these two factors. Further, both benefits were similarly associated with several drivers of social-ecological change (e.g., occupational diversity of forest users, total number of users, and forest size), suggesting identification of potential synergies and complexes of causal mechanisms for future attention. Our analysis shows that forest commons in South Asia, explicitly managed to provide livelihoods for local populations, also provide biodiversity benefits. More broadly, our findings suggest that although strict protected areas are effective tools for biodiversity conservation, a singular focus on them risks ignoring other resource governance approaches that can fruitfully complement existing conservation regimes.

However, urbanization has largely destroyed the original native ecosystems and has caused a homogenization where frequently native species are replaced by non-native species. When attempting to understand the role of trees in urban settings, it is important to generate science-based data on the spatial distribution of trees, their species composition and tree species diversity as a function of the degree of urbanization. Such information may specifically inform the planning of effective long-term management of trees across urban and rural gradients. A total of 23 of 1 ha each were surveyed along a Northern research transect laid out along the urbanâ€“rural gradient of the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India. Plots were randomly selected from the stratum â€œsettlement areasâ€, where WorldView-3 imagery supported both stratification and plot selection. The plots were fully mapped for trees, where a total of eleven variables had been observed for each tree. In addition, the basal area and wood volume was calculated to understand the biomass potential of the trees in the plots. The diversity indices such as the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielouâ€™s evenness and Margalefâ€™s richness were considered for comparing the species diversity, composition and distribution along the gradient of Bengaluru. A total of 1128 individuals of 93 tree species were recorded. Among 92 species identified along the northern gradient, 53 are exotic, and 39 are native species. The Shannonâ€“Wiener index varied from 1.33 to 2.72; Simpsonâ€™s index varied from 0.65 to 0.90; Pielouâ€™s index varied from 0.66 to 0.90, and Margalefâ€™s index ranged from 1.41 to 5.20 along the gradient. The basal area increased from 96.39 m2 to 102.76 m2 from 2017 to 2019 along the transect, with a net gain of 6.37 m2. Similarly, the wood volume increased from 1819.57 m3 to 1926.23 m3 with a net gain of 106.66 m3. The present study reports on tree distribution, species composition and tree species diversity along a gradient from the city center to the rural surroundings of northern parts of Bengaluru city. The information generated may support the city planners/administrators by providing a holistic understanding of the species composition and abundance for a further selection of adaptive species and appropriate tree and vegetation management practices to conserve the existing green spaces and contribute towards sustainable urban planning.

(1) What is the impact of mesoclimatic gradients and dispersal limitation on phylogenetic turnover and species turnover? (2) How does phylogenetic turnover between continents compare in intensity with the turnover driven by climatic gradients at a regional scale? (3) Are independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niche of clades congruent between continents? Location Panama Canal Watershed and Western Ghats (India), two anciently divergent biogeographic contexts but with comparable rainfall gradients. Methods Using floristic data for 50 1-ha plots in each region, independent measures of phylogenetic turnover (?ST) and species turnover (Jaccard) between plots were regressed on geographic and ecological distances. Mesoclimatic niches were reconstructed for each node of the phylogeny and compared between the two continents. Results (1) The phylogenetic turnover within each region is best explained by mesoclimatic differences (environmental filtering), while species turnover depends both on mesoclimatic differences and geographic distances (dispersal limitation). (2) The phylogenetic turnover between continents (?ST = 0.009) is comparable to that caused by mesoclimatic gradients within regions (?ST = 0.010) and both effects seem cumulative. (3) Independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the mesoclimatic niches were strongly correlated between the two continents (r = 0.61), despite the absence of shared species. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate a world-wide deep phylogenetic signal for mesoclimatic niche within a biome, indicating that positive phylogenetic turnover at a regional scale reflects environmental filtering in plant communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2011.00742.x,2012,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Hardy, OJ; Couteron, P; Munoz, F; Ramesh, BR; Pelissier, R",,Data from Ramesh et al.

,,,A0357,134,358,Long-Term Impact of Transhumance Pastoralism and Associated Disturbances in High-Altitude Forests of Indian Western Himalaya,"The Himalayan Mountains are geodynamical important, featuring a wide climatic range with a rich diversity of flora, fauna, human communities, culture, and social set-up. In recent decades, due to constant anthropogenic pressure and considerable changes witnessed in the climate of the region, species of this region are threatened. Here, we assessed the impact of nomadic settlement and associated disturbances on plant species composition, diversity parameters, ecosystem properties, and fire incidence in high-altitude forests of Western Himalaya, India. Based on the distance between nomadic settlement location and forest, we classified forest as near nomadic settlement (NNS) or away nomadic settlement (ANS) forest types. We found a significant variation in plant species composition between forest types. Three species, namely, Sibbaldia cuneata, Poa annua, and Abies pindrow, contribute 25% of the cumulative variation in plant species composition. Studying live plants, we found a significant difference only for density, in which ANS had a higher average density than NNS. Considering dead plants, we found a significant difference in all nine plant-related parameters evaluated between sites. NNS had a higher value of all parameters evaluated, except for height, which was higher in ANS sites. ANS forest type show 1.3 times more average carbon stock (160.39 Â± 59.03 MgChaâˆ’1; mean Â± SD) than NNS forest type (120.40 Â± 51.74 MgChaâˆ’1). We found a significant difference in plant diversity evaluated between forest types. ANS had higher values of Margalef and Fisher diversity but lower values of evenness.

For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast Indiaâ€™s diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha âˆ’1 , respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), subtropical forests (106.01Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), tropical forests (105.33 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), tropical plantations (93.00Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), and temperate plantations (50.10 MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45Â cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ), followed by temperate forests (63.4Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ) and subtropical forests (42.58Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 ). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 , respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64Â MgÂ CÂ ha âˆ’1 in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.724950,2021,FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,"Sahoo, UK; Tripathi, OP; Nath, AJ; Deb, S; Das, DJ; Gupta, A; Devi, NB; Charturvedi, SS; Singh, SL; Kumar, A; Tiwari, BK",,,canopy science; community ecology; mixed-effects model; logging; single rope technique; vascular epiphyte; conservation; Western Ghats,MUNDANTHURAI-TIGER-RESERVE; WET EVERGREEN FOREST; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MONTANE FOREST; SPECIES RICHNESS; LOWLAND FOREST; TREE SIZE; DIVERSITY; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"[Seshadri, K.

Non-destructive method for biomass estimation was adopted for trees whereas harvest method was used to determine the biomass of understorey vegetation, i.e. herbs and shrubs. The total ecosystem carbon density was 247.87 t ha(-1). Carbon partitioning in different components of the chir pine forest ecosystem were ranked in the order of soil layer (190.89 t ha(-1)) > vegetation layer (51.13 t ha(-1)) > detritus (5.85 t ha(-1)). More carbon was recorded in soil than vegetation with a soil: vegetation ratio of 4.4. Less carbon stock in vegetation and detritus may be attributed to the fact that in the Indian Himalayan region, the dependency of communities on forests is causing their over exploitation and degradation.

Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes bl vegetation structure are still occuring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those >7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community, itself may. be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02862149,1998,ECONOMIC BOTANY,"Shankar, U; Murali, KS; Shaanker, RU; Ganeshaiah, KN; Bawa, KS",,,dry deciduous forest; NTFP extraction; wind dispersal; animal dispersal; Soliga,IMPACT,University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore,"Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA; Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, Dept Genet & Plant Breeding, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Univ Agr Sci Bangalore, Dept Crop Physiol, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India; Tata Energy Res Inst, Bangalore 560052, Karnataka, India","Bawa, KS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,

Multi-temporal and multi-resolution geospatial synergic approach incorporating satellite sensors from moderate to high resolution with stratified random sampling design is used. The inventory process involves a continuous forest inventory to facilitate the quantification of possible CO2 reductions over time using statistical up-scaling procedures on various levels. The combined approach was applied on a regional scale taking Himachal Pradesh (India), as a case study, with a hierarchy of forest strata representing the forest structure found in India. Biophysical modeling implemented revealed power regression model as the best fit (R (2) = 0.82) to model the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and biomass which was further implemented to calculate multi-temporal above ground biomass and carbon sequestration. The calculated value of net carbon sequestered by the forests totaled to 11.52 million tons (Mt) over the period of 20 years at the rate of 0.58 Mt per year since 1990 while CO2 equivalent reduced from the environment by the forests under study during 20 years comes to 42.26 Mt in the study area.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3199-y,2013,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Sharma, LK; Nathawat, MS; Sinha, S",,,Carbon sequestration potential (CSP); Agroforestry systems (AFS); Indo-gangetic plains (IGP); Tree biomass; Soil carbon; Area under agroforestry,LITTER DECOMPOSITION; AFFORESTATION; PRODUCTIVITY; STORAGE; CLIMATE; YASSO,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Agroforestry Research Institute,"[Ajit; Dhyani, S.

The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer derived vegetation products, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), leaf area index (LAI), and surface reflectance (SR-645nm and SR-858nm) were fitted to suitable regression curves with respect to plant species richness where NDVI demonstrated the best fit (R-2 = 0.07); while fPAR showed (R-2 = 0.08) better relation with woody species richness. We observed positive but weak correlation for all the biophysiological proxies with species richness in the forests of Western Ghats. The annual pattern of correlation faired than seasonal (i.e., post-monsoon) between biophysical variables and species richness, while the woody subset of the species richness demonstrated marginally better relation at annual scale. The range of each biophysical proxy varied from medium to high, indicating higher vegetation strength. The species richness trend increased linearly for NDVI and EVI. The positive correlation showed by fPAR and LAI could be due to varied canopy architecture of the Western Ghats forests.

,,,A0074,144,75,"Use of TanDEM-X PolInSAR for canopy height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western Ghats, India","Canopy height is a critical parameter in quantifying the vertical structure of forests. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) is a radar remote sensing technique that makes use of polarimetric separation of scattering phase centers obtained from interferometry to estimate height. This article discusses the potential of the X-band PolInSAR pair for forest height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western ghats. A total of 19 fully polarimetric datasets with various spatial baselines acquired from November 2015 to February 2016 in bistatic mode are utilized in this study. After compensating for all possible non-volumetric decorrelations in the data-sets, the remaining volume decorrelation is modeled using a Random Volume Over Ground (RVoG) model to invert height from PolInSAR data. A modified three-stage algorithm developed by Cloude and Papathanassiou ( 2003 ) is adopted for height inversion. PolInSAR derived heights were cross-validated against reference height data measured during a field survey conducted in March 2019. RMSE values of all TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X PolInSAR heights with respect to field measured heights range from 3.3 to 13.8 m and the correlation coefficient r 2 varies between 0.16 and 0.79. The results suggest that the use of a dataset with optimal wavenumber can improve the tree height estimation process. The best performance was achieved for the dataset acquired on 11 December 2015 with RMSE = 3.4 m and r 2 = 0.79. Furthermore, the effects of parameters such as angle of incidence, precipitation, and forest biomass on height inversion accuracy are assessed. A large-scale Shimoga Forest height map was generated using multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions with the best correlation results. To improve the accuracy of the height estimation, a merged height approach is explored. The best height estimates among all PolInSAR estimates for a given field plot are chosen in this regard. The merged height approach gave rise to an improved inversion accuracy with RMSE = 1.9 m and r 2 = 0.92. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the ability of spaceborne X-band data to estimate height with maximum accuracy over natural forests in India, in which height retrieval research has seldom been done.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.836205,2022,FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE,"Raveendrakumar, S; Khati, U; Musthafa, M; Singh, G; Tebaldini, S",,,Buchanania barberi; critically endangered; endemic; germination; global tree assessment; reintroduction; tree conservation; tree establishment,,KSCSTE-Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden & Research Institute (JNTBGRI),"[Dhyani, Anurag; Bindu, Syamala; Abinlal, Kavungulla Chalil; Anilkumar, Chandran] Jawaharlal Nehru Trop Bot Garden & Res Inst, Div Conservat Biol, Karimancode PO Palode, Thiruvananthapuram 695562, Kerala, India","Dhyani, A (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Trop Bot Garden & Res Inst, Div Conservat Biol, Karimancode PO Palode, Thiruvananthapuram 695562, Kerala, India.",Botanic Gardens Conservation International UK [A217]; Mohamed Bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund [180519970],gold,,,,,,,,,

We tested whether stem densities, dominance, the prevalence of rarity, and the proportion of understorey trees are significantly correlated with alpha diversity. Locatiaon The WG is a chain of mountains c. 1600 km in length, running parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula from above 8degrees N to almost 21degrees N latitude. Wet forests occur as a narrow strip in regions with heavy rainfall. Methods To assess tree diversity we used data from 40 small plots, < 1 ha in area, where all trees greater than or equal to 3.18 cm d.b.h. had been inventoried. These plots were distributed across 7 latitudinal degrees and at elevations between 200 and 1550 m. Fisher's alpha was used as a measure of diversity. For each plot, the proportion of trees belonging to the understorey, the proportion of trees belonging to the most abundant species in the plot, as a measure of dominance, and the proportionate representation of singletons, as a measure of rarity, were estimated, and correlated with Fisher's alpha, elevation, rainfall and seasonality. Results Annual rainfall and seasonality increased towards the north, but were not significantly correlated. Tree diversity increased significantly with decreasing seasonality. Tree diversity was not significantly correlated with stem density or with the proportion of understorey tree species, but was significantly correlated with tree dominance and rarity. Dominance increased and rarity significantly decreased with increasing seasonality. Main conclusions This study demonstrates that seasonality influences rain forest tree diversity in the WG of India.

This is particularly important in dry tropical forests that are ecologically different from other forests and are heavily used by local, forest-dependent residents. In this study, we identify biophysical, demographic and use factors associated with differences in species diversity, vegetation structure (abundance at different size classes), biomass and relative abundance of species across the Kanha-Pench landscape in Central India. We sampled vegetation in twenty transects across different human and livestock population densities and frequencies of use. We found that biomass, species diversity and vegetation (abundance at different size classes) are negatively associated with increasing population density, and species composition at different size classes is significantly different at higher frequencies of use at low population densities. Lack of difference in species composition at high population densities may be due to colonization and growth of individuals at some of these sites due to creation of new ecological niches and gaps at high human use. Relative abundance of species at different size classes also varies with frequency of use and population density. Results suggest that human use is altering relative abundance of species, which may change long-term forest composition and thus alter biomass and vegetation structure of the forest. We conclude that human use is an agent in altering long-term composition that can alter availability of tree species for local use and other ecosystem services.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0903-1,2016,REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,"Agarwala, M; DeFries, RS; Qureshi, Q; Jhala, YV",,,Remote Sensing; GIS; Uranium Exploration; Mahakoshal Fold Belt; Son Valley; Madhya Pradesh,CENTRAL INDIA; EASTERN INDIA; MINERALIZATION; GEOCHRONOLOGY; GEOCHEMISTRY; METAMORPHISM; BASKATI; ZONE,Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research (AMD),"[Dwivedi, A.

The major threats to the existing patches are anthropogenic activities such as encroachment of forest area, mining, extraction of forest resources, grazing and forest fire. The present study was carried out at Jarain and adjoining areas of Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya, northeast India to identify the current human disturbances and assess the floristic composition and structure of subtropical broad leaved forest along a fragment size gradient. Floristic sampling was carried out by laying 24 plots (20mx100m) across 10 forest fragments covering a sampled area of 4.8 ha. A total of 160 woody species (>= 5cm dbh) belonging to 105 genera and 54 families were enumerated from all the studied fragments. The species richness was 69 in Small, 75 in Medium, 76 in Very Large (VL) and 77 in Large (L) fragment classes. In this study, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between area, disturbance and phytosociological attributes. The results showed that the stand density increased (r = 0.71, p=0.01), while basal area decreased with disturbance (r =- 0.74, p=0.01). The density was high in 5-15cm dbh class that gradually declined with the increase in diameter. The basal area was high in >66cm dbh class in Very Large fragments whereas in small patches, the values were higher in 16-25cm dbh classes. The forests fragments under study also have a number of rare, endemic and threatened species. Therefore, it is suggested that the entire landscape be brought under the protected area network due to high species diversity.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1504_385407,2017,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Pao, NT; Upadhaya, K",,,Ascidians; CO1 gene; DNA barcoding; Lissoclinum fragile; molecular taxonomy,,,"[Abdul, Jaffarali H.] Islamiah Coll, Dept Biotechnol, Vaniyambadi 635752, Tamil Nadu, India; [Akram, Soban; Arshan, Kaleem M.

We have attempted here to understand the local hydrological dynamics of a sacred forest, in terms of the benefits the village community derive, in central Western Ghats region of India. A comparative assessment has been made between two small watersheds in terms of their landscape structure (woody species composition) with soil water properties and availability of water in the respective downstream villages. The result shows that, sacred site with more primeval vegetation has close association with soil moisture in comparison to non-sacred site during dry spell of the year. The higher soil moisture ensures year long availability of water in the downstream village of the sacred site which facilitates farming of commercial crops with higher economic returns to the farmers, unlike the farmers in the other village where they face water crisis during the lean season.

This study considers variations in the regional fire regime that are related to vegetation type and past human disturbances in a landscape. Using a combination of remote sensing data and GIS techniques, burnt areas were delineated in three different vegetation types and various metrics of fire size were estimated. Belt transects were enumerated to assess the vegetation characteristics and fire effects in the landscape. Temporal trends suggest increasingly short fire-return intervals in the landscape. In the tropical dry deciduous forest, the mean fire-return interval is 6 years, in the tropical dry thorn forest mean fire-return interval is 10 years, and in the tropical moist deciduous forest mean fire-return interval is 20 years. Tropical dry deciduous forests burned more frequently and had the largest number of fires in any given year as well as the single largest fire (9900 ha). Seventy percent, 56%, and 30% of the tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical dry thorn forests, and tropical dry deciduous forests, respectively have not burned during the 7-year period of study. The model of fire-return interval as a function of distance from park boundary explained 63% of the spatial variation of fire-return interval in the landscape. Forest fires had significant impacts on species diversity and regeneration in the tropical dry deciduous forests. Species diversity declined by 50% and 60% in the moderate and high frequency classes, respectively compared to the low fire frequency class. Sapling density declined by ca. 30% in both moderate and high frequency classes compared to low frequency class. In tropical moist deciduous ecosystems, there were substantial declines in species diversity, tree density, seedling and sapling densities in burned forests compared to the unburned forests. In contrast forest fires in tropical dry thorn forests had a marginal positive effect on ecosystem diversity, structure, and regeneration.

In the present study the tree composition, diversity, dominance and carbon stocks in the AGB and soil of tropical forests viz., the Gibbon wildlife sanctuary (GWS) and the Kholahat reserve forest (KRF) of Assam, India were assessed. Soil sampling, tree survey, girth above 1.3 m height of plants >10 cm girth of plants were assessed in 1000 m(2) quadrate. Allometric model for moist forest stands was used to determine AGB and AGBC. A total of 71 and 108 different tree species belong to 32 and 42 families were found in the GWS and KRF, respectively. In the GWF, the Shannon diversity index (1.22) and the Simpson index (0.085) were significant, while for the KRF these indices were insignificant. The basal area, AGB and AGBC in the GWS and KRF were 62.49-90.29 m(2) ha(-1), 135.30 -146.42 Mg ha(-1), and 67.64-73.21 Mg ha(-1), respectively.

However, compared to GWS, a higher AGB and AGBC were found in KRF. This finding reveals that the higher AGB, AGBC and SOC in the KRF were due to old growth matured forest with big and diverse tree species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, the KL isÂ experiencing threats to biodiversity due to theÂ biological overdominance of native Maling bamboo ( Yushania maling ). In the present study, we investigated the impacts of the overdominance of Y. maling on the forest composition of Singalila National Park (SNP), Eastern Himalaya, India. Elevational habitats 2400 to 3400Â m asl were sampled by laying 69 (10Â m Ã— 10Â m) forest plots including 51 bamboo plots and 18 non-bamboo plots. Bamboo plots showed significantly (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) low species richness and density in both shrub and herb layers which further manifested the low seedling density. Generalized Additive Model (GAM) estimated a significant (pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001) decline in species richness and density with increasing bamboo density in SNP. Our study projects the overdominance of Y. maling has a significant negative impact on forest structure and composition. Therefore, management of invasiveness of Y. maling is essential through its optimized removal from the protected areasÂ and utilization in makingÂ handicrafts, paper industries etc. to create ecological and economic benefits. Further long-term studies assessing the impacts of Y. maling overdominance on forest ecosystems and soil dynamics are recommended.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-08483-8,2022,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Gaira, KS; Pandey, A; Sinha, S; Badola, HK; Lepcha, J; Dhyani, PP; Chettri, N",,,biochar; land degradation; microbial activity; SOC management; tropical alkaline soil,CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION; WHEAT CROPPING SYSTEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; HETEROTROPHIC RESPIRATION; SEQUESTRATION; MINERALIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; MATTER; STABILIZATION; DECOMPOSITION,Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology; Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier,"[Seki, Mayuko; Sugihara, Soh; Tanaka, Haruo] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan; [Miyazaki, Hidetoshi] Global Environm Forum, Tokyo, Japan; [Jegadeesan, Muniandi; Kannan, Pandian] Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Bertrand, Isabelle] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro Montpellier, UMR Eco&Sols, INRAE,CIRAD,IRD, Montpellier, France","Sugihara, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Agr, 3-5-8 Saiwai Cho, Fuchu, Tokyo 1838509, Japan.","SUMITOMO Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [17H06171, 17K19308, 18H02315, 20H03113, 20J13165]; TOBITATE!

In the upper Nilgiris of southern India, montane swamps are restricted to geographic areas with flat surfaces and bounded by different edge transition vegetation types including grasslands and shola forests. Our study examined whether species richness, endemism, edge and the composition of swamp interior communities have a significant relationship with swamp area. Using species-area curves we continued sampling for species in each swamp until species richness reached the asympote within that swamp. Our results suggest that species richness (log n), log endemism, and edge and swamp interior species composition do not increase significantly with increasing area due to edge effect. Moreover, swamp area and vegetation parameters showed no significant relationships. However our results did indicate that swamps species richness and endemism were affected by abiotic and biotic edge effects, particularly physical topographic environment and the structure of adjoining matrix vegetation. Therefore swamp protection and restoration, in addition to the preservation and management of buffer regions may be important conservation criteria to preserve these fragile ecosystems.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1204_909929,2014,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,"Mohandass, D; Puyravaud, JP; Hughes, AC; Davidar, P; Ganesh, PS; Campbell, M",,,diabetes mellitus; gestational diabetes mellitus; non-communicable diseases; pregnancy; prevalence,RISK-FACTORS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; CHINESE WOMEN; SOUTH-INDIA; PREVALENCE; COMMUNITY; CONSENSUS; SERVICES; SCENARIO; GLUCOSE,University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"[Kanguru, Lovney; Hussein, Julia; Bell, Jacqueline] Univ Aberdeen, IMMPACT, Sch Med & Dent, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Bezawada, Navya] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med, Sch Med & Dent, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland","Kanguru, L (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, IMMPACT, Sch Med & Dent, 2nd Floor,Hlth Sci Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

In particular, there is no information on the effects of widespread biomass extraction such as grazing and firewood collection. A study was carried out in Sariska Tiger Reserve in northern India, to investigate the effects of biomass extraction on forest vegetation composition, diversity and structure. Biomass extraction caused significant changes in forest vegetation structure and species composition in the tree layer but the extent of these changes varied across the three major vegetation types found in the Reserve. Anogeissus-dominated slope forest showed significantly lower mean canopy cover, tree density, tree basal area and height of trees in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Riparian forest showed lower mean canopy cover, tree basal areas and number of recorded tree species in disturbed sites. Scrub forest had lower mean canopy cover, tree basal area and tree height. There were fewer tall trees but greater number of short trees in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types. Girths of trees similarly shifted towards lower values in riparian and scrub forest. In Anogeissus-dominated forest, disturbed and undisturbed sites did not differ in proportions of trees in various girth-classes. Tree species richness was substantially lower in disturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated and riparian forest in comparison to undisturbed sites, but was not affected by disturbance in scrub forest. Understorey species richness was higher in disturbed sites of all three vegetation types but understorey changed structurally only in Anogeissus-dominated forest. Overall tree and understorey species composition was significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed sites of Anogeissus-dominated forest, but was unchanged in scrub and riparian forest. Observed changes in vegetation structure, diversity and composition of the different vegetation types due to biomass extraction have implications for biodiversity conservation in tropical dry forest ecosystems, and need to be addressed in future forest management planning.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892905002316,2005,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Kumar, R; Shahabuddin, G",,,non-timber forest products; NTFP; people's participation; conservation priority; sustainable use; southern India,,TERI University,"Habitat Ctr, Energy & Resources Inst TERI, New Delhi, India","Silori, CS (corresponding author), So Reg Ctr, Energy & Resources Inst TERI, 4th Main,2nd Cross,Domlur 2nd Stage, Bangalore 560071, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Replicate fallow sites abandoned after shifting cultivation 1, 5, 10, 25 and approximate to 100 years ago, were compared with primary evergreen and semi-evergreen forest using transect and quadrat sampling. 2, Vegetation variables such as woody plant species richness, tree density and vertical stratification increased with fallow age in a rapid. nun-linear, asymptotic manner. Principal components analysis of vegetation variables summarized 92.8% of the variation into two axes: PC1 reflecting forest development and woody plant succession (variables such as tree density, woody plant species richness), and PC2 depicting bamboo density, which increased from 1 to 25 years and declined thereafter. 3, Bird species richness, abundance and diversity, increased rapidly and asymptotically during succession paralleling vegetation recovery as shown by positive correlations with fallow age and PC1 scores of sites. Bamboo density reflected by PC2 had a negative effect on bird species richness and abundance. 4, The bird community similarity (Morisita index) of sites with primary forest also increased asymptotically with fallow age indicating sequential species turnover during succession. Bird community similarity of sites with primary forest (or between sites) was positively correlated with both physiognomic and floristic similarities with primary forest (or between sites). 5. The number of bird species in guilds associated with forest development and woody plants (canopy insectivores, frugivores: bark feeders) was correlated with PCI scores of the sites. Species in other guilds (e. g. granivores, understorey insectivores) appeared to dominate during early and mid-succession. 6, The non-linear relationships imply that fallow periods less than a threshold of 25 years for birds, and about 50-75 years for woody plants, are likely to cause substantial community alteration. 7, As 5-10-year rotation periods or jhum cycles prevail in many parts of north-east India. there is a need to protect and conserve tracts of late-successional and primary forest.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.00297.x,1998,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Raman, TRS; Rawat, GS; Johnsingh, AJT",,,alpha-diversity; beta-diversity; non-parametric estimator; rare species; Simpson's index; topography; tropical forest,TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; POPULATION-SIZE; INDEXES,Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; VetAgro Sup,"Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie Genet & Biol Populat, CNRS, UMR 5558, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; Inst Francais Pondichery, Pondicherry 605001, India","Gimaret-Carpentier, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, Lab Biometrie Genet & Biol Populat, CNRS, UMR 5558, 43 Bd 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2725,169,2726,SECONDARY SUCCESSION AND RESOURCE USE IN TROPICAL FALLOWS: A CASE STUDY FROM THE COROMANDEL COAST OF SOUTH INDIA,"Agricultural fallows, village commons and degraded forests, serve as important common community property resources throughout India, but due to their degraded status they are considered as 'wastelands', having little economic value and poor biodiversity. A study on secondary Succession was conducted in agricultural fallows around Puducherry, India to review the negative image of 'wastelands'. Chronosequences of four sites aged 2, 4, 10 and 50 years were used to investigate change in species composition and abundance, convergence with a nearby forest and to examine their economic use. A comparison of life-forms, species richness and diversity indices showed that herbaceous species dominated up to 10th year sere, from which point in succession, woody species became more common. It was in the 50th year sere that shrubs and secondary tree species occurring in nucleated clumps became dominant. A cluster analysis based on Bray-Curtis similarity index shows a sequential development of vegetation through time, though 50th year plots showed no convergence with the Tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF), but the principal component analysis demonstrates a change in community structure from grasslands to shrub and secondary tree species' dominance. Presence of adults of five primary forest species found in the clumps indicates a fast rate of secondary succession, considering that grazing and resource removal occurred in the sites. The potential value of the 'wastelands' is evident from the fact that 64 per cent of recorded species have economic use, which underlines the need for their sustainable utilization for better management of bioresources rather than converting them into monocultures.

The undisturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands were identified within the sacred grove on the basis of canopy cover, light interception and tree ( cbh greater than or equal to 15 cm) density. The undisturbed forest stand had > 40% canopy cover,> 50% light interception and a density of 2103 trees per hectare, whereas the highly disturbed stand had,< 10% canopy cover, <10% light interception and 852 trees per hectare. The moderately disturbed stand occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. The study revealed that the mild disturbance favoured species richness, but with increased degree of disturbance, as was the case in the highly disturbed stand, the species richness markedly decreased. The number of families of angiosperms was highest ( 63) in the undisturbed stand, followed by the moderately ( 60) and highly disturbed ( 46) stands. The families Rubiaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae were the dominant families in the sacred forest. Rubiaceae was represented by 11, 14 and 10 species in the undisturbed, moderately disturbed and highly disturbed stands, respectively, whilst the family Asteraceae had 16 species in the moderately disturbed stand and 14 species in the highly disturbed stand. The number of families represented by a single species was reduced significantly from 33 in the undisturbed stand to 23 in the moderately and 21 in the highly disturbed stand. The similarity index was maximum ( 71%) between the undisturbed and moderately disturbed stand and minimum ( 33%) between the undisturbed and highly disturbed stands. The Margalef index, Shannon diversity index and evenness index exhibited a similar trend, with highest values in the moderately disturbed stand. In contrast, the Simpson dominance index was highest in the highly disturbed stand. There was a sharp decline in tree density and basal area from the undisturbed ( 2103 trees ha(-1) and 26.9 m(2) ha(-1)) to the moderately disturbed ( 1268 trees ha(-1) and 18.6 m(2) ha(-1)) and finally to the highly disturbed ( 852 trees ha(-1) and 7.1 m(2) ha(-1)) stand. Density - girth curves depicted a successive reduction in number of trees in higher girth classes from the undisturbed to the moderately and highly disturbed stands.

coverage afforded by remote sensing. The present study aims to estimate the above ground tree
biomass (AGB) of forest cover in Khuldia wildlife sanctuary, Balasore district, Orissa, by
combining field inventoried data and multispectral satellite image. We coupled AGB values,
calculated from field measurements of tree diameter at breast height (dbh), with spectral
information derived from IRS P6 LISS-III sensor data through linear regression analyses to
produce an initial biomass map. We found that AGB estimates were strongly related to red
reflectance (r2=0.85 and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; r2=0.69). Our AGB
results are comparable to previously reported values. The total amount of AGB in the study area
(272.75 sq.km.) was estimated as 5353.70 Giga tons and ranged from 75 to 338 Mg/ha with an
average of 196 and a standard deviation of 45 Mg/ha. The AGB class with the highest percentage
(32.1%) was between 250 and 300 Mg/ha. Forests with biomass values 300 to 338 Mg/ha
accounted for less than 10% of the study area and were usually associated with mature trees.

,,,A2875,176,2876,Seed size: a key trait determining species distribution and diversity of dry tropical forest in northern India,"The study examined the relationships among seed size, plant distribution and abundance in a dry tropical forest of northern India. Results indicated that small-seeded species, which were generally wind-dispersed, were more widely distributed, at this local scale, compared to large-seeded species. However, the proportional abundance and basal cover of seed size categories indicated that the structure of the dry forest was largely determined by the medium- to large-seeded species. There was a considerable amount of redundancy within each seed size group, which added to the species diversity. Variability in seed size and the variable degree of shade-tolerance permit the species to occupy the full range of the gradient of light environments of the forest floor. This study revealed that in little to moderately disturbed locations seedlings of large-seeded species increased in abundance, whereas in extremely perturbed locations seedlings of species with medium-sized to small seeds were more abundant.

extraction of these resources can result in the loss of biodiversity. To assess the impact of resource extraction
on forest vegetation, we conducted a study in the dry deciduous forests adjoining the eastern boundary of the
Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the southern western ghats, India. Using 8, 1–ha plots where all
woody species ≥3.18 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) were permanently marked with tags, we estimated
the number of fresh cuttings on branches and stems at 3–month intervals over a period of 2 years. We used
these data to estimate the extraction pressure: [(total number of cuts*100/total number of plants in the plot)/
3] to give monthly percentages for each village. We compared vegetation structure, diversity, basal area and
regeneration in sites with heavy human pressure to control plots where there was no current extraction. On
average, branches and stems from 10% of plants in a hectare of forest were pruned or cut every month.
However, the mean % of branches and stems pruned or cut per month declined from 15% to 8% over the 2
year study period. There was lower species richness, species diversity, and mean height of trees in the
disturbed site, when compared with the undisturbed sites. The basal area and regeneration of plants were
also lower in the disturbed sites. Very few of the species extracted by villagers regenerated in the disturbed

We studied the effect of degree of fragmentation and surrounding matrix on trees, lianas, shrubs and epiphytes in tropical forest fragments of Kodagu, Western Ghats, India. These fragments exist as sacred groves amidst a highly modified agricultural landscape, and have been preserved by the religious sentiments of local communities. Plants were sampled at two sites in continuous forests and 11 forest fragments. A total of 122 species of trees, 29 species of lianas, 60 species of shrubs and 66 species of epiphytes were recorded. Trees exhibited a significant species-area relationship (R (2) = 0.74). Richness estimates after controlling for stem density (rarefaction) revealed that observed species-area relationship was not an artefact of passive sampling. Variation in species richness of the other three groups was explained by stem density and structural diversity. Linear distance from the reserve forest did not explain any variation in species richness. All life forms exhibited significant nested pattern. Trees were nested along the area gradient while nestedness in the other three groups showed evidence in support of habitat nestedness. The four life forms thus responded variably to degree of fragmentation. Our study revealed that 74% of the regional diversity for trees was contributed by diversity among plots, highlighting the importance of inter-patch habitat diversity in maintaining the total regional species pool. We conclude that trees alone cannot serve as good indicator for taking appropriate conservation measures to mitigate species loss resulting from habitat fragmentation.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9638-8,2010,PLANT ECOLOGY,"Page, NV; Qureshi, Q; Rawat, GS; Kushalappa, CG",,,Dairy industry wastewater; Moringa oleifera; Biosorption; Natural adsorbent,AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; REMOVAL; COAGULATION; MECHANISM; SORPTION; PROTEIN; POWDER; SYSTEM; IONS,Universidade Estadual de Maringa; Universidade Federal de Sergipe,"[Salcedo Vieira, Angelica Marquetotti; Vieira, Marcelo F.; Bergamasco, Rosangela] Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Chem Engn, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Silva, Gabriel F.; Araujo, Alvaro A.] Univ Fed Sergipe, Dept Chem Engn, BR-49100000 Sao Cristovao, Sergipe, Brazil; [Fagundes-Klen, Marcia R.; Veit, Marcia T.] W Parana State Univ Toledo, Dept Chem Engn, BR-85903000 Toledo, Parana, Brazil","Vieira, AMS (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Maringa, Dept Chem Engn, Av Colombo 5790, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil.",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we compared tree diversity in two types of coffee management regimes with the sacred groves in the Western Ghats of India. We computed species accumulation curves, species diversity indices and evenness indices to compare the different management regimes. Results of diversity indices showed that shade coffee had less diversity compared to sacred groves. Exotic species dominated the tree diversity in lands where the tree harvesting rights are with the growers. Native trees dominated the tree diversity when growers had no ownership rights on trees. A species accumulation curve suggested that the sacred grove had higher species richness compared to other two habitats. Lack of incentive to preserve endemic species as shade trees is forcing growers to plant more exotic species in shade grown coffee plots. If encouraged, shade grown coffee can preserve some biodiversity, but cannot provide all ecological benefits of a natural forest.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9502-5,2009,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Ambinakudige, S; Sathish, BN",,,Andaman Islands; Disturbance; Invasive species; Species density; Tropical forest; Understory plants,SPECIES RICHNESS; WESTERN-GHATS; GROUND HERBS; DISTRIBUTIONS; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; TREES; GAPS,Pondicherry University,"[Rasingam, L.; Parthasarathy, N.] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India","Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.","Andaman and Nicobar Island Forest Plantation and Development Corporation Limited, Port Blair",,,,,,,,,,
,,,A3204,185,3205,Variation in fine-root biomass and net primary productivity due to conversion of tropical forests into plantation crops and agroecosystems,"The changes in fine-root biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) following conversion of tropical forests (evergreen and deciduous) into forest plantations (teak, Acacia, Albizzia, rubber) and agroecosystems (banana, pepper, cassava, areca-nut) were studied at Kodayar in Western Ghats, South India. Very fine (less than or equal to 1 mm) and fine (> 1 - less than or equal to -3 mm) root biomass and NPP were significantly altered in man-modified ecosystems such as forest plantations and agroecosystems. Very fine-root biomass and NPP were significantly (P < 0.01) greater in natural ecosystems (biomass 245 and 263 g/m(2); NPP 476 and 527 g/m(2)/year) when compared to monoculture plantations (172, 113, 125 g/m(2); 368, 293, 320 g/m(2)/year: respectively) and agroecosystems (88, 104, 97, 156 g/m(2); 227, 301, 295, 376 g/m(2)/year, respectively) except in teak plantations (230 g/m(2); 463 g/m(2)/year, respectively). A similar trend was observed in the case of fine-root biomass. This could be attributed to tree density and basal area along with greater litter accumulation. The lower biomass and NPP in man-modified ecosystems could be attributed to species composition, low organic matter, and soil fertility. Recurrence of annual fire could lead to reoccupation of the land by grass cover. This may be the reason for greater below-ground biomass and NPP in deciduous forests and teak plantations. The present study reveals that fine-root biomass and NPP are significantly altered by anthropogenic perturbation of natural forest ecosystems. Fine roots generally comprise only a small proportion of the total root biomass in an ecosystem, but fine roots are a more accurate indicator of root function than large roots (Berish, 1982). Fine roots located in surface soil layers also are important in nutrient cycling (Medina and Cuevas, 1989) and undergo rapid change in response to perturbations (Hendrick and Pregitzer, 1993).",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),1998,"ROOT DEMOGRAPHICS AND THEIR EFFICIENCIES IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, GRASSLANDS AND FOREST ECOSYSTEMS","Sundarapandian, S; Swamy, P",,,,,Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Forest Coll, Mettupalayam 641301, India","Parthiban, KT (corresponding author), Tamil Nadu Agr Univ, Forest Coll, Mettupalayam 641301, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

However, this information on temperate forests of the Himalayas is lacking and fragmented. In this study, we measured C stocks of tree (aboveground and below-ground biomass), understory (shrubs and herbaceous), deadwood (standing and fallen trees and stumps), floor litter, and soil from 111 plots of 50 m x 50 m each, in seven forest types: Populus deltoides (PD), Juglans regia (JR), Cedrus deodara (CD), Pinus wallichiana (PW), mixed coniferous (MC), Abies pindrow (AP), and Betula utilis (BU) in temperate forests of Kashmir Himalaya, India. The main objective of the present study is to quantify the ecosystem C pool in these seven forest types. The results showed that the tree biomass ranged from 100.8 Mg ha(-1) in BU forest to 294.8 Mg ha(-1) for the AP forest. The understory biomass ranged from 0.16 Mg ha(-1) in PD forest to 2.36 Mg ha(-1) in PW forest. Deadwood biomass ranged from 1.5 Mg ha(-1) in PD forest to 14.9 Mg ha(-1) for the AP forest, whereas forest floor litter ranged from 2.5 Mg ha(-1) in BU and JR forests to 3.1Mg ha(-1) in MC forest. The total ecosystem carbon stocks varied from 112.5 to 205.7 Mg C ha(-1) across all the forest types. The C stocks of tree, understory, deadwood, litter, and soil ranged from 45.4 to 135.6, 0.08 to 1.18, 0.7 to 6.8, 1.1 to 1.4, and 39.1-91.4 Mg ha(-1), respectively, which accounted for 61.3, 0.2, 1.4, 0.8, and 36.3% of the total carbon stock. BU forest accounted 65 % from soil C and 35 % from biomass, whereas PD forest contributed only 26 % from soil C and 74 % from biomass. Of the total C stock in the 0-30-cm soil, about 55 % was stored in the upper 0-10 cm. Soil C stocks in BU forest were significantly higher than those in other forests. The variability of C pools of different ecosystem components is influenced by vegetation type, stand structure, management history, and altitude. Our results reveal that a higher percentage (63 %) of C is stored in biomass and less in soil in these temperate forests except at the higher elevation broad-leaved BU forest. Results from this study will enhance our ability to evaluate the role of these forests in regional and global C cycles and have great implications for planning strategies for conservation.

Forested areas in the lower western Himalaya in India constitute the headwater catchments for many hill streams and have experienced degradation in forest cover due to grazing, deforestation and other human activities. This change in forest cover is likely to alter the soil moisture regime and, consequently, flow regimes in streams. The effect of change in forest cover on soil moisture regimes of this dry region has not been studied through long term field observations. We monitored soil matric potentials in two small watersheds in the lower western Himalaya of India. The watersheds consisted of homogeneous land covers of moderately dense oak forest and moderately degraded mixed oak forest. Observations were recorded at three sites at three depths in each watershed at fortnightly intervals for a period of three years. The soil moisture contents derived from soil potential measurements were analyzed to understand the spatial, temporal and profile variations under the two structures of forest cover. The analysis revealed large variations in soil moisture storage at different sites and depths and also during different seasons in each watershed. Mean soil moisture storage during monsoon, winter and summer seasons was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. Highest soil moisture content occurred at shallow soil profiles, decreasing with depth in both watersheds. A high positive correlation was found between tree density and soil moisture content. Mean soil moisture content over the entire study period was higher under dense forest than under degraded forest. This indicated a potential for soil water storage under well man-aged oak forest. Because soil water storage is vital for sustenance of low flows, attention is needed on the management of oak forests in the Himalayan region.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-013-0355-8,2013,JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH,"Tyagi, JV; Qazi, N; Rai, SP; Singh, MP",,,wood; termite; distribution; abundance; assemblage,SUBTERRANEAN TERMITES; ISOPTERA; INSECTA,Indian Council of Forestry Research & Education (ICFRE); Institute of Wood Science & Technology (IWST),"[Shanbhag, Rashmi Ramesh; Sundararaj, R.] Inst Wood Sci & Technol, Bangalore 560003, Karnataka, India","Shanbhag, RR (corresponding author), Inst Wood Sci & Technol, 18th Cross, Bangalore 560003, Karnataka, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study showed that the fine root biomass, production and turnover varied significantly (P < 0.01) during the course of stand development. Fine root biomass and necromass, respectively, ranged between 314 and 111 g m(-2) in 3yr old stand to 834 and 255 gm(-2) in old growth forest. Proportions of very fine root (< 0.5 mm) to total fine root biomass was significantly high (22%) in the 3yr stand which decreased during the course of ecosystem development (13-16%). Higher root categories showed reverse trend with stand development. Maximum fine root biomass (42-53%) recorded in 0-10cm depth, which decreased significantly (P < 0.05) with increase in depth in all stands. Enhanced ratio of live root biomass to necromass during the course of stand development indicates increasing root vitality.

Species richness (number of species) were 82,142 and 96 species per 0.3 ha respectively for the study areas of low-elevation forest (LEF), mid-elevation forest (MEF) and high elevation forest (HEF). Species diversity indices were greater in MEF compared to the other two forests except juveniles. In contrast, greater dominance value indices were recorded in LEF than other forests. Density and basal area of the MEF were twice greater than the LEF, while HEF showed greater tree density and low basal area when compared to LEF. The stem density and species richness (number of species) decreased with increased size classes of trees observed in the present study indicated good regeneration status. Population structure of juveniles and seedlings also reflects good regeneration status.

In this study, we selected the coniferous forests of Bhallesa Hills, situated in Pir Panjal Mountain (Jammu and Kashmir) of the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot as a study area and used the quadrat method to document the floristic diversity over four years (2018â€“2021). The study sites were divided into four sub-sites (Chilli, Kahal, Chanwari, Gandoh), and at each site, 25 replicated plots (each measuring 2500 m2, 50 Ã— 50 m2) were established for repeated surveys and documentation. We then analysed species diversity, lifeforms, phenology and leaf size spectra of coniferous plant communities. We consulted various pieces of literature to understand native and non-native plants. The results showed that the species diversity and species richness, growth forms and phenology varied in the experimental plots. In total, we found 328 plant species belonging to 228 genera and 78 families from different localities of various growth forms. Approximately 68.51% of the plant species were native, and 31.49%of the species were non-native. In angiosperms, dicotyledon species were found to be dominant, with 83.23% of the total plant species, while the family Asteraceae was common, with 38 species. The biological spectrum analysis showed 29% of the species were chamaephytes, followed by 28% as therophytes and 21% as phanerophytes. We observed that plant communities respond differently to the existing environment drivers, with chamaephyte and therophytes being more tightly linked to temperate mixed-coniferous and alpine ecosystems, affected by climates and the availability of substrates for their growth and existence. The leaf size spectra analyses showed nanophyll (42.81%) as the dominant group.

Diversity was higher in moderately disturbed dunes compared to less or severely disturbed dunes. Among the 38 macrofungi recovered, ten, six, two and one species were edible, ectomycorrhizal, medicinal and considered to be of decorative value, respectively. Ten macrofungi were dominant (>= 5 fruit bodies/625 m(2)) on the coastal sand dunes. These were Amanita sp., Collybia dryophila var. extuberans, C. fusipes, Coprinus plicatilis, Dacryopinax spathularia, Lactarius sp., Lentinus squarrosulus, Marasmius kisangensis, Marasmius sp. 2 and Scleroderma citrinum). The coastal sand dunes are under severe anthropogenic pressure, especially urbanization, sand extraction, agricultural activities and seawall construction. The revegetated dunes are mainly represented by exotic tree species (e.g., Acacia and Casuarina), which are often harvested. Due to the removal of native vegetation and the 'grow and harvest' policy associated with exotic trees, the native flora, fauna and macrofungi of the coastal sand dunes are severely threatened. The results obtained in the present pilot study point out the need for long-term temporal and spatial investigation of the macrofungal resource of coastal sand dunes to gain a more comprehensive knowledge on their abundance, diversity, ecological significance, benefits and what must be done to implement strategies necessary for conservation.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.5943/mycosphere/5/1/6,2014,MYCOSPHERE,"Ghate, SD; Sridhar, KR; Karun, NC",,,Ascomycetes; Basidiomycetes; Himachal Pradesh; Uttarakhand,AMANITA,Mekelle University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University,"[Semwal, K.

Canopy cover-type mapping has been done in most of the bioclimatic zones of India and widely abroad, using aerial photointepretation techniques. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop a methodology for mapping understorey vegetation in part of Kanha National Park, using 1:10,000-scale black-and-white aerial photographs. The Park, one of the best for Tiger (Felis tigris) visibility and observation of other large carnivores and herbivores, has been mapped, with subdivision into 11 vegetation cover-classes and four density-classes, using aerial photographs, and each class has been visited in the field for understorey information concerning different physiographic units. Each category of canopy-cover was sampled in the field, and tree base-cover per hectare has been estimated. Vertical profiles have also been drawn in the main vegetation classes in order to understand the occurrence of understorey vegetation. It was found that a physiographic analysis coupled with canopy-cover type and density, with appropriate sampling in the individual vegetation strata, have together proved indicative of understorey vegetation-type. When the relationship between understorey vegetation and canopy-cover type is established, one can directly depict understorey limits spatially in conjunction with the main vegetation cover. Such an approach of mapping understorey vegetation using aerial photographs could be of immense value for wildlife habitat evaluation and park management.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900021299,1991,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"PORWAL, MC; ROY, PS",,,,,,,"NAIR, KSS (corresponding author), KERALA FOREST RES INST,DIV ENTOMOL,PEECHI 680653,KERALA,INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,A2513,207,2514,Sustaining biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes in the Western Ghats: Remnant forests matter,"Human-modified tropical landscapes under semi-natural or agro-ecosystems often harbor biodiversity of significant conservation value. In the Western Ghats of India, these ecosystems also provide connectivity between protected areas and other remnant forests. We investigated the conservation value of these landscapes and agro-ecosystems using results from 35 studies covering 14 taxonomic groups. Large, conspicuous taxonomic groups and tree-covered land-use types have received much focus in this area of research in the Western Ghats. We computed a response ratio defined as the log ratio of species richness in human land use to species richness in forest control site from 17 studies. In a meta-analysis, we investigated variation of this ratio across studies with respect to three variables: taxonomic group, the land-use type sampled and the extent of forest cover within the study landscape. Higher forest cover within the landscape emerged as a major positive influence on biodiversity in human-modified landscapes for vertebrates and vegetation while no patterns emerged for invertebrates. Our results suggest that loss of remnant forest patches from these landscapes is likely to reduce biodiversity within agro-ecosystems and exacerbate overall biodiversity loss across the Western Ghats. Conservation of these remnant forest patches through protection and restoration of habitat and connectivity to larger forest patches needs to be prioritized. In the densely populated Western Ghats, this can only be achieved by building partnerships with local land owners and stakeholders through innovative land-use policy and incentive schemes for conservation.

,,,A1712,208,1713,Revisiting forest types of India,"Champion and Seth undertook the pioneering work on classification of forests in India. Earlier Sir H. G. Champion had compiled his monumental work 'Preliminary Survey of Forest Types of India and Burma' in 1936. The original work of 1936 was revised by Sir H. G. Champion with S.K. Seth which was published as 'A Revised Survey of the Forest Types of India'. Their work helped the forest managers and researchers all over the Indian sub-continent to prepare management plans for the scientific management of forests. India's forest types are very diverse in their compositions with a long evolutionary and geological history, occurring under many climatic and edaphic conditions. They have been undergoing subtle but significant changes in the composition of forests since the forest types were revised by Champion and Seth. These changes have taken place on account of climatic changes and anthropogenic causes (biotic pressure as well as management interventions). The present study was conducted by revisiting various forest types. It was aimed at assessing the changes that have occurred over a period of time since they were revised by Champion and Seth. The field survey covered more than 200 forest types and subtypes representing very diverse climatic and edaphic conditions across the country. The sample plots were generated randomly across different forest types. Data collected from the field surveys were analyzed for preparing the change matrix of forest types, basal area, importance value index, stem density and diversity indexes including similarity indexes. Impact of climate change on the vegetation was critically examined to see the species level responses to the changes in the rainfall and temperature regimes over the past years. The study has indicated many changes occurring at species and forest subtypes levels. The species level changes were observed largely in Shorea robusta (Sal), Tectona grandis (Teak) and Bamboo forests with regard to their distribution and species density. The study has indicated the absence of teak from very moist and moist teak sub-type and occurrence of many moist deciduous and semi-evergreen species. In central India, the low rainfall regime has shown the decline of Sal and occurrence of dry deciduous species. The study revealed that both positive and negative changes have been witnessed in various forest types. These findings could be used by the policy makers, scientists and foresters for evolving suitable strategies for futuristic management intervention so that the objectives of sustainable forest management are realised. The new classification of forest types has been proposed reflecting the present ecological, climatic, bio-geographic and edaphic influences on the vegetation composition and stand formation. In the proposed new classification, 10 major groups and 48 sub-groups were identified.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1505/146554816818966345,2016,INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW,"Bahuguna, VK; Swaminath, MH; Tripathi, S; Singh, TP; Rawat, VRS; Rawat, RS",,,Casuarina; Expressed sequence tag; Microsatellite markers; Genetic diversity and population structure,SEQUENCE REPEAT MARKERS; EST-SSR MARKERS; RAPD VARIATION; IN-SILICO; INFERENCE; SOFTWARE; PLANTS; ISSR; SPP.,,"[Kullan, A.

Both sites are located within the temperate zone along the altitudinal gradient between 2,800 to 3,400 m asl of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the Western Himalayan Region of India. We recorded a total of 223 species of vascular plants (Angiosperm, Gymnosperm, and Pteridophytes) within the study area. Of the recorded species, plants within the family Rosaceae were dominant (17.69%), followed by Asteraceae (14.97%) and Ranunculaceae (12.93%). Betula utilis had the highest tree density (724 and 324 individuals ha -1 ) and species cover (44% and 36%) at both TLR and BG sites, followed by Pinus wallichiana (24%) and Cedrus deodara (15%), respectively. In BG site, 56% of tree species showed fair regeneration (i.e., seedling density > sapling density â‰¤ adult density), 22% good (i.e., seedling density > sapling density > adult tree density), 11% exhibited poor (i.e., species survived only in the sapling stage but not in the seedling stage), and the remaining (11%) indicated no regeneration. Comparatively, at TLR site, 40% of the tree species showed fair regeneration, 40% good, and the remaining 20% showed no regeneration. Across the two sites, species richness and diversity significantly decreased as the altitudinal gradient increased. Vegetation structure and soil properties also revealed differences between the southern and northern aspects. The baseline information generated in this study is helpful in designing effective conservation and management measures for these ecologically sensitive and important ecosystems. To effectively monitor changes in vegetation structure, species composition, and regeneration, we suggest that permanent vegetation plots with meteorological stations be established across the region for long-term monitoring of forest dynamics in response to the changing climate and anthropogenic pressures.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275051,2022,PLOS ONE,"Maletha, A; Maikhuri, RK; Bargali, SS; Sharma, A; Negi, VS; Rawat, LS",,,Electric vehicles; CO2 emissions; Characteristics of diffusion; Attitude; Purchase intention,BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES; CONSUMER ATTITUDES; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE; WIDESPREAD ADOPTION; PURCHASE INTENTION; DECOMPOSED THEORY; GREEN; ATTRIBUTES; BARRIERS,Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya,"[Arora, Subhash Chander; Sharma, Megha; Singh, Vinod Kumar] Gurukula Kangri Deemed Univ, Fac Management Studies, Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India","Arora, SC (corresponding author), Gurukula Kangri Deemed Univ, Fac Management Studies, Haridwar, Uttarakhand, India.",,"Green Published, Bronze",,,,,,,,,

Methods: Understanding and anticipating the impacts of climate change on Himalayan forest ecosystems and the services they provide to people are critical. Efforts to develop and implement effective policies and management strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation requires particular new research initiatives. The various studies initiated and conducted in the region are compiled here. Results: Several new initiatives taken by the Himalayan Forest Research Institute in Shimla are described. This includes new permanent observational field studies, some with mapped trees, in high altitude transitional zones for continuous monitoring of vegetation response. We have also presented new strategies for mitigating potential climate change effects in Himalayan forest ecosystems. Conclusions: Assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of the Himalayan conifers is required to evaluate potential responses to changing climatic conditions. Conservation strategies for the important temperate medicinal plants need to be developed. The impact of climate change on insects and pathogens in the Himalayas also need to be assessed.

Hence, this study was conducted in reclaimed chronosequence sites (young, intermediate and old) of a large open cast coal project (Central Coal Fields Limited, Jharkhand, India) and results were compared to a reference forest site (Sal forest, Shorea robusta). Mine soil quality was assessed in terms of accretion of soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (N) and soil CO2 flux along with the age of revegetation. After 14 years of revegetation, SOC and N concentrations increased three and five-fold, respectively and found equivalent to the reference site. Accretion of SOC stock was estimated to be 1.9 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Total ecosystem C sequestered after 2-14 years of revegetation increased from 8 Mg C ha(-1) to 90 Mg C ha(-1) (30-333 Mg CO2 ha(-1)) with an average rate of 6.4 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). Above ground biomass contributes maximum C sequestrate (50%) in revegetated site. CO2 flux increased with age of revegetation and found 11, 33 and 42 Mg CO2 ha(-1)year(-1) in younger, intermediate and older dumps, respectively. Soil respiration in revegetated site is more influenced by the temperature than soil moisture. Results of the study also showed that trees like, Dalbergia sissoo and Heterophragma adenophyllum should be preferred for revegetation of mine degraded sites. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

,,,A0141,221,142,Trunk picking from a truncating menu: Dry season forage selection by Asian elephant in a multi-use landscape,"Elephants show a strong selection towards areas with high foraging opportunities at the landscape level making top-down decisions by first selecting patch types within landscapes and finally species within them. Understanding forage selection in a multi-use landscape is critical for prioritising patches for habitat management, ensuring availability of selected forage, helping in minimizing pressure on food crops and subsequent negative interactions with people. We assessed dry season forage selection in a multi-use landscape of West Bengal state, India. Relative forage use and relative plant species availability ratio were calculated to assess forage selection in a multi-use landscape comprising of the forest, tea estates, agricultural land, and human settlement. Forage use was assessed using the opportunistic feeding trail observation method (150.01 km). Stratified random sampling was used to assess plant species availability using the quadrat method (123 plots of 0.1 ha each). Among 286 plant species recorded, 132 plant species were consumed by elephants. A majority (80.21%) of plant species were consumed more than the proportional availability thereby showing selective foraging during the dry season in the study area. From forest to semi-open forest and open forest, canopy layer tree density and the total number of species decreased whereas invasive species density increased. This indicates the high impact on the forage species availability for elephants and the requirement of appropriate habitat management strategies. The presence of 32.14% of the selected forage species in human-use landscape alone demands the development of conservation interventions. This is the first study to assess forage selection by elephants in a multi-use landscape and used to prioritise conservation and management strategies at a landscape level.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271052,2022,PLOS ONE,"Das, P; Kshettry, A; Kumara, HN",,,Blue carbon; Mangrove; Seagrass; Salt marsh; Aboveground biomass; Belowground biomass; Soil carbon pool,ORGANIC-CARBON; PALK BAY; SEAGRASS ECOSYSTEMS; MANGROVE FORESTS; GROUND BIOMASS; EAST-COAST; SEDIMENTS; MATTER; STOCKS; SOIL,Port & Airport Research Institute; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Jadavpur University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"[Akhand, Anirban] Port & Airport Res Inst, Coastal & Estuarine Environm Res Grp, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan; [Akhand, Anirban] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Ocean Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chanda, Abhra] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India; [Jameel, Yusuf] MIT, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dasgupta, Rajarshi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Integrated Sustainabil Ctr ISC, Hayama, Kanagawa, Japan","Chanda, A (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata, W Bengal, India.",Asia Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) under Collaborative Regional Research Programme (CRRP) [CRRP2018-03MY-Hashimoto],,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1348,222,1349,Phylogenetic diversity patterns in Himalayan forests reveal evidence for environmental filtering of distinct lineages,"Large-scale environmental gradients have been invaluable for unraveling the processes shaping the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. Environmental gradients provide a natural setting to test theories about species diversity and distributions within a landscape with changing biotic and abiotic interactions. Elevational gradients are particularly useful because they often encompass a large climatic range within a small geographical extent. Here, we analyzed tree communities in plots located throughout Arunachal Pradesh, a province in northeast India located on the southern face of the Eastern Himalayas, representing one of the largest elevational gradients in the world. Using indices of species and phylogenetic diversity, we described shifts in community structure across the landscape and explored the putative biotic and abiotic forces influencing species assembly. As expected, species richness and phylogenetic diversity decreased with increasing elevation; however, contrary to predictions of environmental filtering, species relatedness did not show any clear trend. Nonetheless, patterns of beta diversity (both taxonomic and phylogenetic) strongly suggest lineage filtering along the elevational gradient. Our results may be explained if filtering is driving the assembly of species from distinct evolutionary lineages. New metrics exploring community contributions to regional taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity provided additional evidence for the persistence of unique communities at high elevations. We suggest that these patterns may be consistent with filtering on glacial relicts, part of once more diverse clades with convergent traits suited to climates at the last glacial maximum, resulting in random or over-dispersed community assemblages at high elevations. We propose that these high-elevation sites with evolutionarily distinct species represent possible regions for conservation priority that may provide refugia for species threatened by current warming trends.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2157,2018,ECOSPHERE,"Shooner, S; Davies, TJ; Saikia, P; Deka, J; Bharali, S; Tripathi, OP; Singha, L; Khan, ML; Dayanandan, S",,,BBCH scale; footstalk; jackfruit; phenology,CHEMISCHE-INDUSTRIE SCALE; BIOLOGISCHE-BUNDESANTALT; BUNDESSORTENAMT; CODIFICATION,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Institute of Horticultural Research,"[Kishore, Kundan] ICAR IIHR, Cent Hort Expt Stn, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","Kishore, K (corresponding author), ICAR IIHR, Cent Hort Expt Stn, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A2220,225,2221,"A landscape-level assessment of Asian elephant habitat, its population and elephant-human conflict in the Anamalai hill ranges of southern Western Ghats, India","Spatial information at the landscape scale is extremely important for conservation planning, especially in the case of long-ranging vertebrates. The biodiversity-rich Anamalai hill ranges in the Western Ghats of southern India hold a viable population for the long-term conservation of the Asian elephant. Through rapid but extensive field surveys we mapped elephant habitat, corridors, vegetation and land-use patterns, estimated the elephant population density and structure, and assessed elephant-human conflict across this landscape. GIS and remote sensing analyses indicate that elephants are distributed among three blocks over a total area of about 4600 km(2). Approximately 92% remains contiguous because of four corridors; however, under 4000 km2 of this area may be effectively used by elephants. Nine landscape elements were identified, including five natural vegetation types, of which tropical moist deciduous forest is dominant. Population density assessed through the dung count method using line transects covering 275 km of walk across the effective elephant habitat of the landscape yielded a mean density of 1.1 (95% Cl = 0.99-1.2) elephant/km(2). Population structure from direct sighting of elephants showed that adult male elephants constitute just 2.9% and adult females 42.3% of the population with the rest being subadults (27.4%), juveniles (16%) and calves (11.4%). Sex ratios show an increasing skew toward females from juvenile (1:1.8) to sub-adult (1:2.4) and adult (1:14.7) indicating higher mortality of sub-adult and adult males that is most likely due to historical poaching for ivory. A rapid questionnaire survey and secondary data on elephant-human conflict from forest department records reveals that villages in and around the forest divisions on the eastern side of landscape experience higher levels of elephant-human conflict than those on the western side; this seems to relate to a greater degree of habitat fragmentation and percentage farmers cultivating annual crops in the east. We provide several recommendations that could help maintain population viability and reduce elephant-human conflict of the Anamalai elephant landscape.

Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in regulating carbon cycling, thus having a significant impact on global environmental change. Extensive studies have been conducted for the estimation of mangrove species identification and biomass estimation. However, estimation at a regional level with species-wise biomass distribution has been insufficiently investigated in the past because either research focuses on the species distribution or biomass assessment. Study shows that good relationship has been achieved between stem volume (field measured data) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from satellite image and further these two indices are employed to estimate thebiomass in the study site. Three models- linear, logarithmic and polynomial (second degree) are used to estimate biomass derived from EVI and NDVI. The hyperspectral data (spatial resolution similar to 30m) is utilised to identify ten mangrove plant species. We have prepared the spatial distribution map of these species using spectral angle mapper. We have also generated mangrove species-wise biomass distribution map of the study site along with areal coverage of each species.The results indicate that the Sonneratia apetala Buch.-Ham. and Cynometra iripa Kostel has the highest biomass among all ten identified species, 643.12Mgha(-1) and 652.14Mgha(-1). Our study provided a positive relationship between NDVI, EVI, and the estimated biomass of Bhitarkanika Forest Reserve Odisha India. The study finds a similar results for both NDVI and EVI derived biomass, while linear regression has more significant results than thepolynomial (second degree) and logarithmic regression derived biomass. Thepolynomial is foundslightly better than thelogarithmic when using theEVI as compared to NDVI derived biomass. The spatial distribution of species-wise biomass mapobtained in this study using both, EVI and NDVI could be used to provide useful information for biodiversity assessment along with thesustainable solutions to different problems associated with the mangrove forest biodiversity. Thus, biomass assessment of larger regions can be achieved by utilization of remote sensing based indices as concluded in the present study.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01698-8,2019,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Pandey, PC; Anand, A; Srivastava, PK",,,GLM; Landscape metrics; PFTs; Predictive modelling; Remote sensing,SPECIES RICHNESS; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; GRADIENTS; FOREST; SPACE; DISTRIBUTIONS; DETERMINANTS; EXPLANATION; PERFORMANCE,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Wildlife Institute of India","[Padalia, Hitendra; Bushra, Aimon; Nandy, Subrata] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Gajendra] Uttarakhand Space Applicat Ctr, Forestry & Climate Change Div, 93-2 Vasant Vihar, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rai, Ishwari Datt; Rawat, Gopal S.] Wildlife Inst India, PB 18, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttar Pradesh, India","Padalia, H (corresponding author), Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to quantify and compare the plant diversity and carbon stock in a subtropical broadleaved and a subtropical pine forest of Meghalaya, northeast India. Biomass-based carbon estimation was undertaken in two subtropical broadleaved forest stands viz., Mawnai (MBF) and Nongkrem (NBF) and adjacent Pinus kesiya dominated forest stands (MPF and NPF), occurring in similar topography, climatic conditions and soil type. The aboveground and belowground tree biomass was estimated using existing allometric models. Carbon was estimated as 47.4% of the total biomass. Tree species richness was greater in the subtropical broadleaved forest stands at MBF and NBF (117 and 21 species) than in the adjacent pine forests, MPF and NPF (15 and 16 species). The density values were 1294 and 1127 individuals ha−1 in the broadleaved forest stands, and 894 and 1032 individuals ha−1 in the adjacent pine forest stands, respectively.

This study, therefore, aims to assess the above- and belowground carbon storage potential of a semi-arid forest ecosystem of Delhi.MethodsFor the study, two forest sites were selected, i.e., north ridge (NRF)and central ridge(CRF). Aboveground tree biomass was estimated by using growing stock volume equations developed by Forest Survey of India and specific wood density. Understory biomass was determined by harvest sampling method. Belowground (root) biomass was determined by using a developed equation. For soil organic carbon (SOC), soil samples were collected at 0-10-cm and 10-20-cm depth and carbon content was estimated.ResultsThe present study estimated 90.51Mgha(-1) biomass and 63.49MgCha(-1) carbon in the semi-arid forest of Delhi, India. The lower diameter classes showed highest tree density, i.e., 240 and 328 individuals ha(-1) (11-20cm), basal area, i.e., 8.7 (31-40cm) and 6.08m(2)ha(-1) (11-20cm), and biomass, i.e., 24.25 and 23.57Mgha(-1) (11-20cm) in NRF and CRF, respectively. Furthermore, a significant contribution of biomass (7.8Mgha(-1)) in DBH class 81-90cm in NRF suggested the importance of mature trees in biomass and carbon storage. The forests were predominantly occupied by Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC which also showed the highest contribution to the (approximately 40%) tree biomass. Carbon allocation was maximum in aboveground (40-49%), followed by soil (29.93-37.7%), belowground or root (20-22%), and litter (0.27-0.59%).ConclusionOur study suggested plant biomass and soils are the potential pools of carbon storage in these forests. Furthermore, carbon storage in tree biomass was found to be mainly influenced by tree density, basal area, and species diversity. Trees belonging to lower DBH classes are the major carbon sinks in these forests. In the study, native trees contributed to the significant amount of carbon stored in their biomass and soils.

Longer wavelength radar data at L-band sensor provides improved forest biomass (AGB) information due to its higher penetration level and sensitivity to canopy structure. The study presents a regression based woody biomass estimation for tropical deciduous mixed forest dominated by Shores robusta using ALOS PALSAR mosaic (HH, HV) and field data at the lower Himalayan belt of Northern India. For the purpose of understanding the scattering mechanisms at L-band from this forest type, Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering model (MIMICS-I) was parameterized with field data to simulate bacicscatter across polarization and incidence range. Regression analysis between field measured forest biomass and L-band bacicscatter data from PALSAR mosaic show retrieval of woody biomass up to 100 Mg ha(-1) with error between 92 and 94 Mg ha(-1) and coefficient of determination (r(2)) between 0.53 and 0.55 for HH and HH + HV polarized channel at 0.25 ha resolution. This positive relationship could be due to strong volume scattering from ground/trunk interaction at HH-polarized while in combination with direct canopy scattering for HV-polarization at ALOS specific incidence angles as predicted by MIMICS-I model. This study has found that L-band SAR data from currently ALOS-1/-2 and upcoming joint NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) are suitable for mapping forest biomass <= 100 Mg ha(-1) at 25 m resolution in far incidence range in dense deciduous mixed forest of Northern India.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.03.007,2018,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION,"Ningthoujam, RK; Joshi, PK; Roy, PS",,,Functional traits; Phylogenetic turnover; Deciduous; Evergreen; Niche-based processes; Human disturbance,BETA-DIVERSITY; COASTAL CALIFORNIA; CLIMATIC GRADIENTS; AMAZONIAN FOREST; REGIONAL-SCALE; PLANT TRAITS; WOOD DENSITY; PATTERNS; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY,Concordia University - Canada; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore,"[Shivaprakash, K.

Birds were observed in 19 100-m-long transects, 3 times per season per transect, for 2 seasons from 1997 to 1998 and 1998 to 1999, in an area where forests are subject to various degrees of pressure from human disturbances. Closed canopy forests with relatively undisturbed habitat showed significant variation in habitat attributes, suggesting complexity of habitat structure. Bird species richness and diversity were significantly related to moderately disturbed habitats represented by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where vegetation heterogeneity (vertical stratification and species composition) was greater. Analysis by migratory groups did not show an interpretable relationship with the habitats, except for the seasonal movements of migratory groups when correlated with altitudinal gradient along the corridor However, feeding guilds showed significant relationships when correlated with different habitat types. Guilds such as insectivores showed a significant positive relationship with relatively undisturbed habitat, whereas nectarivores and granivores were associated with disturbed habitat. Such relationships have the potential to help assess bird communities and their habitat preferences.

Cedrus deodara occurs in pure forest stands throughout the Western Himalayas and has high biomass and soil carbon sequestration potential. The present study aims to provide the contribution of the Cedrus deodara forests under the current stresses for climate mitigation by analysing the three elevation ranges of the Dhanaulti forest division of Garhwal Himalaya, India. The results report that soil organic carbon (SOC) was adversely and bulk density favourably related with elevation. Moreover, SOC as CO2eq also decreased significantly with an increase in soil depths. Biomass carbon for various parts of the plant was also estimated for the three elevations of the Cedrus deodara forests. The trend in total carbon stock (bole, branch, twig, foliage and soil) decreased significantly with an increase in altitude. The carbon stock of Cedrus deodara forests was maximum (545 t ha−1) at upper altitude (2350 m.a.s.l) and minimum (330 t ha−1) at a lower altitude (2050 m.a.s.l). The difference in litter production between the seasons is significant with maximum production in summer followed by rainy and winter seasons.

The forests of Eastern Ghats of India are also relatively under studied compared with the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a large-scale, landscape-level investigation of liana diversity in six hill complexes of the South Eastern Ghats, which covers 4297 km2. We divided the study area into 6.25 km x 6.25 km grids and within each grid a 0.5 ha (5 m x 1000 m) transect was established and all lianas epsilon 1.5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were inventoried in 110 transects totalling a 55-ha area. Liana diversity totalled 143 species in 83 genera and 37 families in the 55 ha sampled. Of these 20 species (28.6%) were endemic to peninsular India and 7 (10%) species belonged to the rare and endangered category. Liana species richness ranged from 8-35 species and density 95-544 individuals per transect. A total of 32 033 liana individuals were enumerated in the 55 ha and the mean abundance was 291 individuals per transect. Across sites, liana abundance varied significantly, but not species richness and basal area. Asclepiadaceae (13 species, 9%) and Apocynaceae (11 species, 8%) constituted the most diverse liana families, followed by Papilionaceae, Vitaceae (10 each, 7%), Convolvulaceae, Mimosaceae, Oleaceae (8 each, 6%), Capparaceae, Rhamnaceae (7 each, 5%) and Menispermaceae (5 species, 3%). In liana stem size distribution, the lowest diameter class (1.5-3 cm dbh) accounted for greatest species richness (137 species, 96%), abundance (27358 individuals, 85%) and basal area (13.5 m2, 36%). The stem twiners were the predominant climber type in terms of species richness (61 species, 42.65%), whereas the armed scramblers were abundant due to stem density (21571 individuals, 67.34%). The dispersal modes of lianas, assessed by fruit types, revealed zoochory as the prevalent mode (85 species, 59%) indicating the faunal dependence of lianas in the Eastern Ghats landscape. Liana diversity of the Eastern Ghats was compared with inventories made across the tropics. With these baseline data generated on lianas, the importance of biodiversity conservation of the already fragmented South Eastern Ghats region is underlined and potential areas of further research on liana ecology are suggested.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1080/14772001003723546,2010,SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY,"Muthumperumal, C; Parthasarathy, N",,,,PROTECTIVE ROLE; EAST-COAST; MANGROVE; SCENARIO; IMPACT,Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Institute of Oceanography (NIO),"Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India","Mascarenhas, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Oceanog, Panaji 403004, Goa, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

These transects were assigned to 7 vegetation types and were shown to be distinctive in species composition. These types include closed canopy evergreen, semi-closed canopy evergreen, stunted evergreen, semievergreen, moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and scrub/savanna vegetation. Dry deciduous forests with low levels of density and diversity harbour a rather exclusive set of species. The most diverse tree assemblages belong to the semievergreen forest type, which harbours widespread species extensively shared with other vegetation types. The semiclosed evergreen forests resemble semievergreen forests in many ways. In contrast, the stunted evergreen forests and scrub/savanna exhibit low values of tree density and diversity; their component species have very weak tendencies to co-occur with each other. The evergreen and moist deciduous forests exhibit moderate to high density and diversity and moderate levels of distinctiveness of species composition. The evergreen forests however resemble dry deciduous forests in harbouring species with a strong tendency to co-occur and many species with restricted distributions. More moist vegetation types shelter a higher proportion of evergreen and endemic trees and a lower proportion of medicinally-useful species.

The present study aims to assess the biomass and soil carbon (C) stock in the hydroelectric catchment in India and further, its implications to mitigate GHG emissions. The estimation depicts the low ‘C’ stock in the reservoir’s catchment in comparison to reservoirs located globally in the same eco-region which will ultimately result in lower GHG emission in the future. Moreover, estimated total carbon density of the forest species was found as 54.92 ± 18.07 MgC.ha−1 while mean SOC was 79.64 ± 19.32 MgC.ha−1. The average total ‘C’ stock of Tehri hydroelectric reservoir’s catchment was estimated as 134.56 MgC.ha−1. Moreover, ratios (total flooded carbon/installed capacity) comprised between 4 and304 kgC/W from the other reservoirs reported globally. These ratios are higher than the Tehri reservoir (0.28 kgC/W) as flooded area of Tehri reservoir during impoundment was 52 km2. Thus, Tehri reservoir was found to emit less GHG in time to come.

,,,A1604,241,1605,Sapling harvest: A predominant factor affecting future composition of tropical dry forests,"Degradation of tropical forests is of global concern and studies of the ecosystem processes concerned with the regeneration of trees have a great value for reforestation management. We analysed the structure of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in India in terms of the composition of small-diameter trees (saplings) at five distinct sites located along a gradient of soil moisture, and investigated the effects of biotic and abiotic disturbances on the diversity, aboveground biomass (AGB), AGB-accumulation, annual recruitment index (ARI) and annual mortality index (AMI) of saplings. Aim of the study was to analyse the relative impact of important disturbing factors on the species composition of saplings in the TDF. Study questions were: (1) how is the TDF structured in terms of tree saplings and their AGB? (2) what are the levels of biotic and abiotic disturbances which affect sapling population, forest regeneration and future composition of the community? (3) what is the relationship between species mortality and recruitment in the sites having different disturbance intensities? and (4) what is the relative importance of individual disturbing factors for the recruitment, mortality and structure of sapling community? Stepwise multiple regressions were performed for predicting species richness, stem density, mean AGB, AGB-accumulation, ARI and AMI from mean values of soil moisture content (SMC), harvest index, browse index, drought index and fire index. Results showed 80, 15, 4.5 and 0.5%, mortality through harvest, browse, drought, and fire, respectively. Floristic composition of the sapling population was different compared to that of the mature trees. Selective harvesting of the saplings of large canopy trees such as Terminalia tomentosa and Shorea robusta indicated the possiblity of change in floristic composition of the TDF in future. Tree saplings in our TDF are mainly damaged by illegal harvesting. Compared to browsing and natural mortality on account of drought and fire, damage to saplings due to harvesting was substantially higher at most of the study sites. In this study, the site which had the lowest level of SMC throughout the year, contained the lowest number of species and sapling stems and also had the greatest level of disturbance in terms of damaged saplings. In order to protect and improve the diversity and recruitment of tree saplings, we suggest to restrict the illegal (unauthorized) harvesting and to control browsing in the forest. Particularly the saplings of the dominant canopy trees and those with high biomass accumulation potential need to be protected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We derived dissimilarity matrices between all pairs of the 36 sampling sites with respect to forest structure, floristics, and bird species composition and ran Mantel's randomization tests to detect significant associations among the matrices after partialling out the effect of geographic distance between sites. Bird species composition was found to be significantly related to forest structure across habitats, and floristics within the moist-deciduous forests. This finding is consistent with earlier observations that birds respond, in their species composition, to vegetation structure across habitats and to vegetation composition within a habitat. As predicted, the composition of insectivorous birds was influenced by forest structure, but the phytophagous guild did not show any relation to vegetation composition in contrast to patterns observed elsewhere. We explain this anomaly as a result of availability of a wide choice of food plants for phytophagous birds in central Indian tropical forests and weak species-environment relationships on account of their nomadism. Extraction of non-timber forest products remains a key economic activity in central India and our results imply that it can potentially influence the composition of forest bird communities through alteration of forest structure and floristics.

,,,A2792,246,2793,"Effects of extractive disturbance on bird assemblages, vegetation structure and floristics in tropical scrub forest, Sariska Tiger Reserve, India","A study was carried out in a tropical scrub forest in India, to investigate the effects of extractive activities such as fodder and firewood collection, on native bird communities and to study the relative influences of altered vegetation composition and structure. The study was based on comparison between six 'disturbed' (extracted) and four 'undisturbed' (non-extracted) sites that were delineated using quantitative disturbance indicators. Birds were sampled seven times over two different seasons utilising the fixed radius point count method. Six different variables related to vegetation structure (canopy cover, basal area, average forest height, tree density, tree height diversity and tree species richness) were quantified, as was tree species composition. There was no significant difference in number of recorded species or bird abundance between disturbed and undisturbed sites. However. bird species diversity was significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. Overall, bird species composition also differed significantly between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Nine of 38 locally abundant bird species (23.6%) showed significant selection for either disturbed or undisturbed habitats. Of these nine species, seven chose undisturbed habitats and two chose disturbed. All seven species adversely affected by disturbance are primarily insectivorous. Canopy cover, tree basal area and height of trees were significantly lower in disturbed sites in comparison to undisturbed sites. In both habitats, bird species composition was significantly dependent on these components of altered vegetation structure. Tree species composition was also significantly altered by disturbance in scrub forest. However, altered tree species composition did not significantly affect bird species composition. Partial Mantel's tests confirmed that there were no significant residual effects of tree species composition on bird composition after the effects of vegetation structure were accounted for. Our study indicates that rural biomass extraction can have significant effects upon bird species composition of tropical scrub forest which is caused principally by alteration of vegetation structure, rather than by changes in forest tree composition.

Research has focused on tree diversity inside these forest patches. In a coffee-growing region of the Western Ghats, however landscape outside sacred groves is also tree covered because Planters have retained native trees to provide shade for coffee plants. We examined the diversity of trees, birds, and macrofungi at 58 sites-10 forest-reserve sites, 25 sacred groves, and 23 coffee plantations-in Kodagu district. We measured landscape composition and configuration around each site with a geographic information system. To identify factors associated with diversity we constructed multivariate models by using a decision-tree technique. The conventional measures of landscape such as patch size did not influence species richness. Distance of sacred groves front The forest reserve bad a weak influence. The measures of landscape structure (e.g., tree cover in the surroundings) and stand structure (e.g., variability in canopy height) contributed to The variation in species richness explained by multivariate models. We suggest that biodiversity present within sacred groves bets been influenced by native tree cover in the surrounding landscape.

In the present study, forest biomass was assessed by integrating remotely-sensed satellite data and field inventory data using an artificial neural network (ANN) technique in Barkot forest, Uttarakhand, India. Spectral and texture variables were derived from Resourcesat-1 (RS1) LISS-III (Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor) data of April 24, 2013. ANN was used for finding the relation of spectral and texture variables to field-measured biomass. The top 10 variables, namely shortwave infrared (SWIR) band reflectance, near infrared (NIR) band reflectance, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), green band contrast, green band variance, SWIR band contrast, NIR band dissimilarity, SWIR band second angular moment, and red band mean, were selected for generating a multiple linear regression model to predict the biomass. The predicted biomass showed a good relationship (R-2 = 0.75 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 85.32 Mg ha(-1)) with field-measured biomass. The model was validated yielding R-2 = 0.74 and RMSE = 93.41 Mg ha(-1).

We tested the hypotheses that fragmentation and expected seed-dispersal declines (1) reduce sapling densities and species richness of all species and old-growth species, and increase recruitment of early-successional species, (2) reduce the prevalence of dispersed recruits and (3) increase influence of local overstorey on sapling densities and richness. Continuous forests and fragments had similar sapling densities and species richness overall, but density and richness of old-growth species declined by 62% and 48%, respectively, in fragments. Fragments had 39% lower densities and 24% lower richness of immigrant saplings (presumed dispersed into sites as conspecific adults were absent nearby), and immigrant densities of old-growth bird-dispersed species declined by 79%. Sapling species richness (overall and old-growth) increased with overstorey species richness in fragments, but was unrelated to overstorey richness in continuous forests.

Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha(-1) and 2.79 to 4.92 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson's index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76 t ha(-1), respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59-3.53 t ha(-1) year(-1) while the C sequestration potential of 0.71-1.57 t ha(-1) year(-1) under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6246-2,2017,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Jhariya, MK",,,Gross primary productivity (GPP); leaf area index (LAI); aggregated canopy model (ACM); Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); tropical forest; MetFlux India,LEAF-AREA INDEX; DECIDUOUS BROADLEAF FOREST; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; PRIMARY PRODUCTION GPP; SOIL CO2 FLUX; EDDY-COVARIANCE; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MODIS-GPP; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; NATIONAL FOREST,Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM); Centre for Climate Change Research - India; Tezpur University; University of Edinburgh; Savitribai Phule Pune University,"[Burman, Pramit Kumar Deb; Chakraborty, Supriyo] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Sarma, Dipankar] Tezpur Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Tezpur 784028, India; [Williams, Mathew] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Karipot, Anandakumar] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Atmospher & Space Sci, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India","Burman, PKD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.","Earth System Science Organization (ESSO) of Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India","Green Accepted, Bronze",,,,,,,,,

Gautala Autramghat is a protected area of the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state, India. It is situated in the Satmala and Ajantha hill ranges of the Western Ghats; it is administrated by Aurangabad and Jalgaon District. The wildlife sanctuary was established in an existing reserved forest area in 1986. The area is a southern tropical dry deciduous forest with scattered bush and grasslands. India, being a mega-biodiversity country, supports diverse forest vegetation of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate types. The remote-sensing techniques are employed to map the forest cover. IRS RS2 LISS III sensor data are used to generate a medium-scale vegetation cover map. One scene of 01-Feb-2015 with minimum cloud cover was acquired, preprocessed, and georeferenced to Survey of India toposheets.

Species inventory was taken in 25 m(2) plots, established at 10 m intervals along edge to interior transects. The measured soil variables included pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and soil moisture, Microenvironmental factors including light transmittance, relative humidity, and air and soil temperatures also were monitored. Both edaphic and microenvironmental factors exhibited strong patterns along the edge to interior gradient, Forest edges were characterized by higher light transmittance, higher air and soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity. Soil variables including pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and moisture increased toward the forest interior. Significant increases in organic carbon (53.9%), total nitrogen (47%), and soil moisture (55%) indicated a relatively fertile forest interior compared with the forest edge. A definite floristic compositional pattern also was observed along the edge to interior gradient which was correlated to the edaphic and microenvironmental variables as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. It appears that edge effects in these high altitude forests penetrate to a distance of 15-30 m. Further, edaphic factors have an important influence on woody species regeneration, perhaps much more than microenvironmental factors, This indicates that any disturbance that significantly exposes the forest floor, thus lowering soil moisture and altering soil nutrient status, can adversely affect the regeneration of many of the shola species.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1127(96)03836-4,1996,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,"Jose, S; Gillespie, AR; George, SJ; Kumar, BM",,,Bambusa arudinacea; biomass productivity; nutrient cycling; teak plantation,FOREST,,,"Chandrashekara, UM (corresponding author), KERALA FOREST RES INST, PEECHI 680653, KERALA, INDIA.",,,,,,,,,,,

Ollur Kavu, S.N. Puram Kavu and Iringole Kavu which represent above mentioned management systems, respectively, were studied far their tree species composition and vegetation structure. The study was also designed to assess the strengths and weaknesses of present management systems and role of different stakeholder groups in conserving the sacred groves. Of the three sacred groves, the one managed by individual family (Ollur Kavu) is highly disturbed as indicated by low stem density of mature trees (367 ha(-1)) and poor regeneration potential with the ratio between mature trees and saplings is 1:0.4. In order to quantify the level of disturbance in these sacred groves, Ramakrishnan index of stand quality (RISQ) was calculated. The values obtained for all the three tree layers (i.e., mature trees, saplings and seedlings) in single family managed sacred grove (Ollur Kavu) was between 2.265 and 2.731, an indicator of the dominance of light demanding species in the population, suggested that the grove is highly disturbed one. Whereas, other two sacred groves are less disturbed as indicated by lower 'RISQ' values (between 1.319 and 1.648). Iringole Kavu and S.N. Puram Kavu were compared with some other evergreen forests of the Western Ghats of India for the parameters like stem density, basal area and species diversity of trees (gbh greater than or equal to 10.1 cm). Values obtained for these parameters in the two sacred groves are within the range obtained for other forests. Stakeholder importance value index (SIVI) was calculated based on the attributes like the proximity of the stakeholder to the sacred grove, contribution of stakeholders in managing the sacred grove, benefits being enjoyed by the stakeholder due to involvement with sacred grove and attitude of the stakeholder group towards the conservation and management of sacred grove. This indicated that local people, temple trust and/ or sacred grove owners are the major stakeholders, while in general some other stakeholder groups such as youth clubs, schools, forest department, municipality and local Panchayat with lower SM are comparatively neutral in conserving and managing the groves. Some of the major strategies to be adopted are self-imposed complete ban on the removal of biomass for the revitalisation of ecosystem, creation of awareness among local people and all stakeholder groups, identification of the type of contribution a stakeholder group can offer in managing the sacred grove and encouragement of all stakeholders to participate without either directly or indirectly adversely affecting the ecosystem as well as the wisdom and interest of the major stakeholder groups.

The present study was aimed to assess the above ground and below ground carbon stock and its relation with tree diversity parameters in two tropical moist deciduous forest sites, namely: Xylia dominated forest (XDF) and Sal dominated forest (SDF) of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), Odisha, India. A total of seventy-two tree species ≥ 5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were recorded, belonging to 62 genera and 27 families. Estimated average above-ground biomass carbon and soil organic carbon were 180.05 Mg C ha−1, 55.4 Mg C ha−1 and 209.3 Mg C ha−1, 61.8 Mg C ha−1 in XDF and SDF of SBR, respectively. Shorea robusta Gaertn. was the most carbon accumulating species of both the forests contributing about 21.5% of biomass carbon in XDF and 47.8% biomass carbon in SDF. Maximum carbon allocation was in above-ground biomass pool (69.04%) followed by soil organic carbon (20.9%) and below-ground biomass/root (10.1%). The correlation study revealed that above-ground biomass had strong positive correlation with basal area and Importance Value Index of tree species indicating importance of dominant species in carbon storage. Therefore, the dominant tree species such as S. robusta Gaertn., Xylia xylocarpa (Roxb.) Taub., Terminalia tomentosa Wight & Arn., Schleichera oleosa Lour.)

Investigations were carried out at a site covering the major dominant forest species grown in India. Cartosat-1 stereo data were analysed in conjunction with differential global positioning system (DGPS) measurements to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) and an orthoimage, which were used to estimate the biophysical variables. Analysis using grey-level co-occurrence texture measures was performed for separation of forest species, homogeneity of the classes of forest stands, stratification and measurement of crown area, canopy gap and stand density. Field measurements of tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), stand density, age and crown diameter were conducted for each stand. Empirical models for the estimation of DBH were developed and validated with Cartosat-1-derived height and crown diameter. Measured and estimated values were found to be in close proximity to each other. A local contrast co-occurrence measure (contrast, mean and variance) was suitable for the estimation of average crown diameter, stand density and canopy gap area for each forest stand class. The texture image provided information on structural attributes (i.e. stand density, crown diameter and canopy gap of the forest tree stands).

Multivariate analyses revealed a significant association of all environmental covariates with plant species assemblage. Pairwise tests indicated that L. camara was significantly associated with changes in plant species assemblage and grass cover within the moist and dry deciduous forest, but not in the thorn forest. The relationship between L. camara and that of elephant browse plants varied with species. A linear regression analysis indicated that L. camara invasion was the only significant predictor of grass occupancy. Our results indicate that in addition to other factors, L. camara was associated with altering plant species assemblage, some elephant browse plants and grass cover in the moist and dry deciduous forest.

The aboveground biomass (AGB) was 273 ± 55.5 in the SF, 195 ± 32.12 in the RF and 75.3 ± 17.1 Mg ha−1 in the VF whereas, the corresponding belowground biomass (BGB) was 59.53 ± 8.4, 44.48 ± 7.5 and 19.9 ± 4.3 Mg ha−1, respectively. Overall, there was a 30% reduction of AGB in RFs and 70% in VFs as compared to the SFs. The mean AGBC stock was 129 ± 26.3, 92.49 ± 15.2 and 39 ± 5.7 Mg C ha−1 in SF, RF and VF. The BGBC ranged from a minimum of 6 to 34 Mg C ha−1 in the study sites. The AGB accumulation was greater in intermediate diameter classes (26 − 45.9 cm) in the RFs and VFs whereas in SFs the diameter class >65cm accounted to about 27-69% of the total AGB. Human disturbance had a strong influence on the species richness and stand characteristics that in turn influence the biomass and C stock in the community forests.

Design/methodology/approach - A set of 100 home gardens and 40 bamboo groves were selected from Irongmara and Dargakona village, in Cachar district, Assam, North East India through random sampling. Sampling was done mostly for smallholders. Culm growth, carbon storage, carbon sequestration and carbon in litter floor mass and soil of bamboo growing areas in homegarden was explored from 2003-2007. Findings - Culm growth extension revealed the brief periodicity of culm growth in a single growth period. Of the total carbon storage soil contributed 84.6 per cent of the total (50.1 Mg ha(-1)) followed by carbon in above ground vegetation 15 per cent (9 Mg ha(-1)) and carbon in litter floor mass 0.4 per cent (0.2 Mg ha(-1)). Practical implications - Bamboo plantation development and its management in home gardens has social, ecological and economical benefits for the rural life in North East India and its promotion can become an effective choice for climate change mitigation strategy. Originality/value - Bamboo forms an important component in the traditional home garden system of North East India where the practice of bamboo cultivation and management provides an important sink for CO2. Village bamboos play an important role in local economics, societies and environments and, considering its potential to mitigate global climate change, the authors recommend the promotion of bamboo in agroforestry expanding practices and rehabilitation of degraded lands. Management of village bamboos in rural landscape is highlighted in context to environmental sustainability and as a sink measure under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of Kyoto Protocol.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1108/17568691211223169,2012,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,"Nath, AJ; Das, AK",,,,VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; NORTHERN INDIA; SOUTHERN-OCEAN; BLACK CARBON; CCN CHAMBER; AEROSOL; SPECTRA; CITY; ACTIVATION,Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur,"[Patidar, V.; Tripathi, S.

In the ten independent sites, a 100 m x 100 m permanent plot was established, and all trees >= 10 cm girth at breast height were enumerated, their girth measured and tagged. Tree diversity totalled 77 species in 61 genera of 30 families. Tree density varied from 596 to 2813 stems ha(-1), and basal area ranged between 12.4 and 36.5 m(2) ha(-1). Species richness did not show any significant variation within and between the inland and coastal areas. We examined the relationship between basal area and site disturbance scores between the five sites of inland and coastal forest areas and found a negative correlation in both the areas. The coefficient of variability in species distribution among the ten sites revealed the extent of species heterogeneity. The number of species and stems decreased from the smallest to largest girth class. The tree inventories of the studied sites when compared with those of other tropical dry evergreen forests showed great differences in density and basal area, probably due to different geographical location and varying annual rainfall patterns.

,,,A3207,277,3208,Investigating canopy regeneration processes through individual-based spatial models: application to a tropical rain forest,"Observations of circular structures in a permanent plot in a natural dense tropical forest of the Western Ghats (India) led to formulation of new hypotheses on the spatial organization resulting from interactions between trees. Here we propose a canopy regeneration process that does not involve treefall gaps. The peculiar spatial circular structure is composed of a central dominant tree with less than two trees under its crown and five or more other trees forming a ring at the limit of its crown. Such a structure is supposed to occur under certain conditions and, in particular, under strong competition for light. We describe a regeneration mechanism based on replacement of the central tree by a shift to one of the trees in its peripheral ring so that progressive recovery of the canopy occurs without large gap dynamics. We built a spatial simulator of forest dynamics in order to investigate the occurrence of such spatial structures and to examine their role in canopy regeneration. The model is an individual-based spatial model for mixed uneven-aged forest stands and accounts for annual evolution of the trees in the simulated stand, incorporating mortality, recruitment, growth and competition processes. The main originality of this model lies in the description of crown growth in eight cardinal directions, and in the use of neighbor position and size to express competitive interactions. The model demonstrates the development of the circular spatial structures in simulated stands as those observed in the permanent plot and shows that the proposed canopy regeneration mechanism can occur in the absence of perturbation.

Tree provides both tangible (timber, fuelwood, etc. For humans) and intangible benefits (as climate security through C sink) that maintains ecosystem processes. Tropical Sal forests are gaining popularity due to its remarkable contribution as C sink, storage, budget and flux. In the present study, an effort has been made to explore vegetational statistics along with C storage, budget and flux in four different site qualities (SQ) of Sal dominating tropical deciduous forest of Chhattisgarh, India. The density (individuals/ha) and basal area (m2/ha) varied from 710 to 1010 and 33.5–46.8 in tree, 2000–2500 and 0.32–0.33 in sapling and 9750–14500 and 17.96–21.43 in seedling, respectively in varying SQ. The total biomass varied from 182.27 to 375.84 t/ha in varying SQ. The total C in trees varied from 79.86 to 163.63 t ha−1. Quantity of C in above ground and below ground portions in trees on different sites were 72.32–143.36 t/ha and 7.54–20.27 t/ha, respectively. Total aboveground tree C sequestration values ranged between 5.12 and 11.68 t C ha−1yr−1 on different SQ. The C storage and net fluxes were represented in compartment models to assess the various SQ. As per models, forest received 14.63, 10.81, 8.19 and 6.83 t/ha/yr of C input through net primary production (NPP) in SQ-I, SQ-II, SQ-III and SQ-IV, respectively which are depleted as 3.55, 3.12, 2.77 and 2.33 t/ha/yr as total C input in the soil. Moreover 1.77 (SQ-I), 1.60 (SQ-II), 1.46 (SQ-III) and 1.30 (SQ-IV) t ha−1 yr−1of C were transferred from foliage to litter compartment, respectively.

Overall, 1964 lianas representing 30 species belonging to 24 genera and 18 families were recorded in this study. Liana species richness declined in both the sites since initial inventory. The TDEF sites revealed an overall increase in stem density for the families Loganiaceae, Papilionaceae, Tiliaceae, Combretaceae, and Celastraceae. The site PP subjected to extreme anthropogenic disturbances reported considerable decrease in its stem density. The diameter class 1–3 cm also revealed substantial decline in its stem density. The endemic species Derris ovalifolia showed an increase in its stem density in 19 years. Anthropogenic disturbances resulted in significant decrease in abundance of species such as Gymnema sylvestre and Jasminum angustifolium, which are known for their medicinal value.

On using method 1, the AGB varied from 39.69 to 170.02 Mg ha(-1) and by method 2, it varied from 73.06 to 173.10 Mg ha(-1). The relationship between BA and AGB yielded a positive correlation for all the five sites of inland and coastal areas. The basic wood specific gravity of 41 tree species determined by oven-dry weight by volume, ranged from 0.46 to 0.92 g cm(-3) for inland sites and 0.47 to 0.89 g cm(-3) for the coastal sites.

,,,A1986,286,1987,Altered stand structure and tree allometry reduce carbon storage in evergreen forest fragments in India's Western Ghats,"Tropical forests are among the largest terrestrial reservoirs of carbon, and play an important role in regulating global climate. However, as a result of historic and ongoing deforestation, carbon storage in this biome is increasingly dependent on forests that are fragmented and used by humans, with considerable uncertainty about how such disturbance alters carbon storage potential and cycling. Here, we evaluate differences in above-ground carbon stocks between fragmented and contiguous evergreen forests in the central Western Ghats, India. We also assess differences in the structure, tree allometry and functional composition of forest stands between contiguous and fragmented forests, and explore how these differences influence carbon storage in fragmented forests. Relatively large, well-protected forest fragments currently store 40% less carbon per hectare above ground than contiguous forests. These differences in carbon are related to (i) lower tree density and basal area in fragments, (ii) lower average stand height in fragments, and (iii) compositional shifts favoring species with lower wood densities. Reduced stand height in fragments was associated with intra-specific variation in tree allometry, with trees in fragments being relatively shorter at any given diameter than conspecifics in contiguous forests. Further, the relatively skewed distribution of carbon storage within a few large trees in current-day fragments is added cause for concern: carbon stocks in fragments are likely to decline further in the future, following the eventual death of large trees. Active management and restoration to mitigate ecologically driven changes in habitat structure and species composition might be as important as improved management of resource use and protection from exploitation in order to sustain carbon storage ecosystem services provided by these tropical forest fragments.

(ii) What are the levels of CD and CA in the stem component of tree species in the mono- and multi-specific stands? (iii) Which vegetation characteristics strongly account for the variations in CD and CA in the tree species in the mono- and multi-specific stands? We established 15 stands (six mono- and nine multi-specific stands), each having 4 ha area in the forest region. Total number of species across the stands was 46 belonging to 25 families. Average tree density ha(-1) and stem basal area (BA, m(2) ha(-1)), across the stands were 522 and 11.1, respectively. Margalef s index of species richness (SR), Whittaker's index of species evenness (Ew) and Shannon-Wiener index (H') were greater at multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. Average wood specific gravity (WSG) across species for the mono-specific (Teak) was greatest compared to the other categories. Across the mono- and multi-specific stands, WSG among species ranged between 0.47 and 0.79 g cm(-3), with 26.2% having WSG >= 0.70 g cm(-3). Across the plots in mono- and multi-specific stands, stem density showed positive correlation with BA and aboveground stem biomass (AGB). The associations of SR with Ew and H', and Ew with H' were significantly positive. The AGB was positively associated with SR, Ew and BA. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant effects of year, stand and species for DBH, height and AGB. Average aboveground CD and CA across the stands were 136 t-C ha(-1) and 53 t-C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Results of step-wise multiple regression indicated that across the stands, CD was influenced by BA and H', and CA was affected by SR and BA. Principal component analysis exhibited strong association of CA and CD with multi-specific stands compared to mono-specific stands. Teak and Sal trees showed maximum CA per unit BA at multi-specific stand compared to mono-specific stand. These findings can be used by the forest managers to increase the carbon density and accumulation in Teak and Sal forests of India. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Patient and provider costs of telemedicine screening and hospital-based DR treatment were estimated through interviews with 100 diabetic patients, sampled when attending screening in rural camps (n = 50) or treatment at the base hospital in Chennai (n = 50), and with program and hospital managers. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR screening test were assessed in comparison with diagnosis using a gold standard method for 346 diabetic patients. Other model parameters were derived from the literature. A Markov model was developed in TreeAge Pro 2009 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA) using these data. Main Outcome Measures: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the current teleophthalmology program of 1-off screening in comparison with no screening program and the cost-utility of this program at different screening intervals. Results: By using the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness, the current rural teleophthalmology program was cost-effective ($1320 per QALY) compared with no screening from a health provider perspective. Screening intervals of up to a frequency of screening every 2 years also were cost-effective, but annual screening was not (>$3183 per QALY). From a societal perspective, telescreening up to a frequency of once every 5 years was cost-effective, but not more frequently. Conclusions: From a health provider perspective, a 1-off DR telescreening program is cost-effective compared with no screening in this rural Indian setting. Increasing the frequency of screening up to 2 years also is cost-effective. The results are dependent on the administrative costs of establishing and maintaining screening at regular intervals and on achieving sufficient coverage.

,,,A2553,290,2554,Comparative Genome Analysis Provides Insights into the Evolution and Adaptation of Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi on Aesculus hippocastanum,"A recently emerging bleeding canker disease, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pathovar aesculi (Pae), is threatening European horse chestnut in northwest Europe. Very little is known about the origin and biology of this new disease. We used the nucleotide sequences of seven commonly used marker genes to investigate the phylogeny of three strains isolated recently from bleeding stem cankers on European horse chestnut in Britain (E-Pae). On the basis of these sequences alone, the E-Pae strains were identical to the Pae type-strain (I-Pae), isolated from leaf spots on Indian horse chestnut in India in 1969. The phylogenetic analyses also showed that Pae belongs to a distinct clade of P. syringae pathovars adapted to woody hosts. We generated genome-wide Illumina sequence data from the three E-Pae strains and one strain of I-Pae. Comparative genomic analyses revealed pathovar-specific genomic regions in Pae potentially implicated in virulence on a tree host, including genes for the catabolism of plant-derived aromatic compounds and enterobactin synthesis. Several gene clusters displayed intra-pathovar variation, including those encoding type IV secretion, a novel fatty acid biosynthesis pathway and a sucrose uptake pathway. Rates of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the four Pae genomes indicate that the three E-Pae strains diverged from each other much more recently than they diverged from I-Pae. The very low genetic diversity among the three geographically distinct E-Pae strains suggests that they originate from a single, recent introduction into Britain, thus highlighting the serious environmental risks posed by the spread of an exotic plant pathogenic bacterium to a new geographic location. The genomic regions in Pae that are absent from other P. syringae pathovars that infect herbaceous hosts may represent candidate genetic adaptations to infection of the woody parts of the tree.",Y,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010224,2010,PLOS ONE,"Green, S; Studholme, DJ; Laue, BE; Dorati, F; Lovell, H; Arnold, D; Cottrell, JE; Bridgett, S; Blaxter, M; Huitema, E; Thwaites, R; Sharp, PM; Jackson, RW; Kamoun, S",,,Intra-annual variations; teak; oxygen isotope,TECTONA-GRANDIS; NORTHERN THAILAND; LEAF WATER; TREE-RINGS; RATIOS; ENRICHMENT; RECORDS; LEAVES; CARBON; DELTA-O-18,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Physical Research Laboratory - India; University of Agricultural Sciences Bangalore; Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM)","[Managave, S.

The dose association of sacred forests with local people represents a community-based, participatory approach to conservation. Our quantitative analysis in five sites documented 78 tree species of 66 genera and 33 families. Tree density and species diversity were higher than previously reported for the forests of the Eastern Ghats, India. Population structure and regeneration potential in four out of five study sites showed a higher percentage of density in the seedling and sapling layers, demonstrating that these sites are regenerating. However, in the Gugarpat sacred forest, the population structure revealed large numbers of mature trees with a stable population structure. In our study, large proportions of species had either poor regeneration potential or were not regenerating. Hence, management strategies are needed to conserve these species. Our study documents the diversity, population patterns, and regeneration of the tree species of five sacred forests, which may help in further management and conservation of the biodiversity of sacred forests in India and globally.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2018.1522148,2019,ECOSCIENCE,"Pradhan, A; Ormsby, A; Behera, N",,,Heritability; genetic advance; growth attributes; cluster composition; agroforestry,EUCALYPTUS-GRANDIS; CLONAL TRIALS; GROWTH TRAITS,Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,"[Parthiban, K.

Three 1-ha plots were established, one each in (i) an undisturbed site (named site UD), (ii) in a site selectively felled 35 years ago (site SF - small stems felled leaving the large trees (as shade) for developing it into a cardamom estate, on the failure of which the site was abandoned) and (iii) a frequently disturbed site (site FD - round woods logged for use in ovens for curing cardamom). These sites are 1 to 3 km apart in the same wet evergreen forest. In the three study plots a total of 2150 stems (mean density 716 ha(-1)) covering 122 species in 89 genera and 41 families were enumerated. Species richness was greatest (85 species ha(-)1) in the undisturbed site UD, intermediate (83) in SF and lowest (80) in FD. Tree density was greatest (855 stems ha(-)1) in site SF, intermediate (720) in UD and lowest (575) in FD. The forest stand was exceptionally voluminous in site UD (basal area 94.64 m(2) ha(-1)), intermediate (66.9 m(2)) in SF and least (61.7 m(2)) in FD, due to tree removal for fuel in the latter sites. Species composition and abundance patterns markedly varied between the three sites. In UD and SF, primary forest species (Cryptocarya bourdillonii , Cullenia exarillata Myristica dactyloides etc.) occurred in greater density. In FD heliophilic secondary forest species (Elaeocarpus venustus, Litsea wightiana, Viburnum punctatum and Vitex altissima) were abundant, while these were absent in UD and SF. The species-area curve did not reach an asymptote in any of the sites on the 1-ha scale. The stand population structure was clearly reverse 'J' shaped in UD and SF, while small stems were 2- to 3-fold fewer in FD. Most trees exhibited clumped distribution of individuals on the 1-ha scale. Variation in the kind and richness of species and their abundance is related to human interference and the need for forest conservation is emphasized.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008949407385,1999,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Parthasarathy, N",,,multi-purpose trees; site-specific growth; nitrogen-use-efficiency; shoot/root ratio; transplantation performance,FAMILIES; BIOMASS,Madurai Kamaraj University,"Madurai Kamaraj Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Madurai 625021, Tamil Nadu, India","Paliwal, K (corresponding author), Madurai Kamaraj Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Dept Plant Sci, Madurai 625021, Tamil Nadu, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Field measurement (GBH, LAI, litter, soil moisture) was carried out over ten quadrates of 0.1ha in KNP for characterization of biophysical parameters with specified measurement protocol and sampling. Satellite based remote sensing analysis (LAI, Phenology, and NPP) was carried out using multi date observations of IRS-LISS-III, IMS-1MX, SPOT-VEGETATION and EOS-MODIS instruments. Rank correlation analysis using field data collected in the selected quadrates at KNP showed Sal (Shorea robusta) is dominant forest species followed by Lendia, Jamun (Syzygium cumini), Saja, Harra and Dhawda etc. Field measurement of Sal showed GBH range from 20 cm to 170 cm. Different forest classes such as Sal; Sal mixed with Jamun, Bamboo (Dendrocalamus strictus) etc, including grasslands/scrubland were classified with overall accuracy of 85.56 percent using March, May and October multi spectral data. Sal has distinct growth characteristics (low vegetation growth/leaf fall in March instead of May) as compared to other vegetation species. As per the Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurement using hemispherical photographs, Sal showed the highest LAI (6.95 m(2)/m(2)) during September and lowest LAI (2.63 m(2)/m(2)) during March. Overall good agreement (r=0.79) was found between the LAI generated from LISS-III and MODIS data product.

In this study, the forest phytomass has been assessed in range of subtropical and temperate forest dominated by tree species of Quercus semicarpifolia Sm. and Pinus roxburghii Sarg in Himalayan region Purola tehsil in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand state of India. In-situ measurements of the phytomass were taken with clustered sampling approach on a total of 40 plots (0.1 ha each), i.e. in 10 MODIS pixels with 4 plots laid in an individual pixel. The field measured phytomass was found in the range of 67.76 - 1,108 t ha(-1). Weighted-area phytomass was estimated at an individual MODIS (MOD13Q1, 250m) pixel where in-situ measurements varied from 207.93 t ha(-1) - 1,042 t ha(-1). The best fit equation of pixel phytomass values was regressed on red, infra-red and vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from the MODIS data. The correlation between the measured phytomass and NDVI was found significant and maximum in the month of December (R value -0.71, p < 0.01). However, such a relationship was not persistent throughout the year. The R-2 value between observed phytomass and predicted phytomass was 0.53. The predicted phytomass based on 250x250 m MODIS data varied from 216.88 - 1,011 t ha(-1).

The work also intended to study the variation in the proportion of lianas with trees along an altitudinal gradient and to compare the functional traits of lianas and trees sharing similar environmental conditions. All lianas >= 1.5 cm diameter and trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height were measured and included the inventory. A total of 237 liana species were enumerated across the four forest types. The species richness of lianas per hectare was maximum at semi-evergreen forest (31 +/- 5.3) and minimum at dry evergreen forest sites (21 +/- 3.9). Semi-evergreen forest sites of Eastern Ghats also had the highest density (648 +/- 152.7 ha(-1)) of liana stems and wet-evergreen forest sites of Western Ghats registered the lowest (261 +/- 86.7 ha(-1)). Dry evergreen forest sites on the Coromandel Coast recorded the highest basal area (0.75 +/- 0.44 m(2) ha(-1)) and the above ground biomass (22.77 +/- 19.1 Mg ha(-1)) of lianas across the study sites followed by the semi-evergreen forest sites (0.69 +/- 0.3 m(2) ha(-1) and 10.01 +/- 6.2 Mg ha(-1)). The proportion of liana species richness to total woody species decreased along the altitudinal gradient in the present study. Majority of lianas in the study sites were brevi-deciduous by plant type except in wet-evergreen forest sites. Stem twining was the chief climbing mechanism by species richness and scramblers formed the most abundant liana group by abundance. Majority of lianas had microphyllous leaves, whereas trees had mesophyllous leaves as their predominant leaf type. Flowers of SEF and SDF sites were mostly conspicuous, while the flowers of DEF sites were largely inconspicuous.

To understand how shifts in rainfall may alter these carbon pools, above-ground biomass (AGB), soil organic carbon (SOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) of tropical forest covers were measured across a rainfall gradient (543-1590 mm) in Gujarat (India), a state falling under semi arid to tropical dry-wet conditions. Species diversity, tree density and soil texture were also measured. Field visits and data collection were carried out for 2 years (2009-2011) in 95 plots of 250 x 250 m in the forest covers across four distinct rainfall zones (RFZs). Data analysis showed that differences seen in the values of the measured parameters across the RFZs are statistically significant (P < 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between mean annual precipitation (MAP) and tree density, species diversity, AGB, SOC, and MBC. Across the RFZs, AGB ranged between 0.09 and 168.28 Mg ha(-1); SOC values (up to 25 cm soil depth) varied between 2.94 and 147.84 Mg ha(-1). Soil texture and MBC showed a significant impact on the dynamics of SOC in all the RFZs. MBC is more influenced by SOC rather than AGB. Both vegetation type and MAP have an important role in the regulation of SOC in tropical soils.

In Nepal, the deer is confined to protected areas throughout the Himalaya. It is a solitary and shy forest dweller with a crepuscular activity pattern. It prefers and repeatedly uses one or more specific defecation sites. Such behaviour is believed to function in chemical communication among individuals. This study was conducted in Neshyang valley in the Annapurna Conservation Area, and aims to evaluate how musk deer selects the latrine site in its habitat taking into account both biotic and abiotic factors.

This study assesses the potential of multitemporal L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data to improve forest AGB estimation using the three-parameter water cloud model (WCM) trained with field data from relatively small (0.1 ha) plots. The major objective is to assess the impact of the high uncertainties in field inventory data due to relatively smaller plot size and temporal gap between acquisitions and ground truth on the AGB estimation. This study analyzes a time series of twenty-three ALOS-2 dual-polarized images spanning 5 years acquired under different weather and soil moisture conditions over a subtropical forest test site in India. The WCM model is trained and validated on individual acquisitions to retrieve forest AGB. The accuracy of the generated AGB products is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE). Further, we use a multitemporal AGB retrieval approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated AGB. Changes in precipitation and soil moisture affect the AGB retrieval accuracy from individual acquisitions; however, using multitemporal data, these effects are mitigated. Using a multitemporal AGB retrieval strategy, the accuracy improves by 15% (55Â Mg/ha RMSE) for all field plots and by 21% (39Â Mg/ha RMSE) for forests with AGB less than 100Â Mg/ha. The analysis shows that any ten multitemporal acquisitions spanning 5Â years are sufficient for improving AGB retrieval accuracy over the considered test site.

Lowest average bulk density (D-b) of 0.95 was found same in S3 (sigma +/- 0.07) and S5 (sigma +/- 0.09) and highest D-b (1.08) was observed in S2 (sigma +/- 0.05). A relatively higher coarse fraction was observed in all the six strata ranging from 19.23 (SD +/- 4.66) in S3 to 29.37 (sigma +/- 6.12) in S6. Soil pH ranged from 6.09 (sigma +/- 0.64) in S4 to 6.97 (sigma +/- 0.53) in S2. The region under biotic interference has observed significant deforestation and degradation in the past two decades leading to lower SOC% values compared to other studies in the adjoining regions of Indian Himalayas and temperate coniferous forests in general. SOC% values were observed to range from 1.03 (sigma +/- 0.22) in S2 to 2.25 (sigma +/- 0.23) in S3. SOC density ranged between 25.11 (sigma +/- 5.41) t ha(-1) in S2 and 51.93 (sigma +/- 5.24) t ha(-1) in S3. SOC CO2 mitigation density was found highest 190.59 (sigma +/- 19.23) t ha(-1) in S3 and lowest 92.16 (sigma +/- 19.86) t ha(-1) in S2. A significant variation was observed in SOC density within strata. SOC density values in closed strata in general exceed to those in open strata. Primary results indicate that the average SOC stock for all the strata is low due to continuous biotic pressure in the last two decades making it a potential region for SOC buildup under plus options of REDD + (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) which includes conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon (C) stocks.",Y,Checklist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9466-y,2014,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,"Wani, AA; Joshi, PK; Singh, O; Bhat, JA",,,forest; Shannon Index; species richness; RS and GIS; land use; NDVI,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; VEGETATION; INDIA; CLASSIFICATION; LANDSAT; PATTERN; GIS,Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya (IGKV),"[Thakur, Tarun; Swamy, S.

Our study was carried out in the Bhitarkanika Conservation Area (BCA), the second-largest mangrove area in eastern India. We assessed total ecosystem carbon (C) stocks at four land use types representing varying degree of disturbances. Ranked in order of increasing impacts, these sites included dense mangrove forests, scrub mangroves, restored/planted mangroves, and abandoned aquaculture ponds. These impacts include both natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances causing stress, degradation, and destruction of mangroves. Mean vegetation C stocks (including both above-and belowground pools; mean +/- standard error) in aquaculture, planted, scrub, and dense mangroves were 0, 7 +/- 4, 65 +/- 11 and 100 +/- 11 Mg C/ha, respectively. Average soil C pools for aquaculture, planted, scrub, and dense mangroves were 61 +/- 8, 92 +/- 20, 177 +/- 14, and 134 +/- 17 Mg C/ha, respectively. Mangrove soils constituted largest fraction of total ecosystem C stocks at all sampled sites (aquaculture [100%], planted [90%], scrub [72%], and dense mangrove [57%]). Within BCA, the four studied land use types covered an area of similar to 167 km(2) and the total ecosystem C stocks were 0.07 Tg C for aquaculture (similar to 12 km(2)), 0.25 Tg C for planted/restored mangrove (similar to 24 km(2)), 2.29 teragrams (Tg) Tg C for scrub (similar to 93 km(2)), and 0.89 Tg C for dense mangroves (similar to 38 km(2)). Although BCA is protected under Indian wildlife protection and conservation laws, similar to 150 000 people inhabit this area and are directly or indirectly dependent on mangrove resources for sustenance. Estimates of C stocks of Bhitarkanika mangroves and recognition of their role as a C repository could provide an additional reason to support conservation and restoration of Bhitarkanika mangroves. Harvesting or destructive exploitation of mangroves by local communities for economic gains can potentially be minimized by enabling these communities to avail themselves of carbon offset/conservation payments under approved climate change mitigation strategies and actions.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1890/15-2143,2016,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"Bhomia, RK; MacKenzie, RA; Murdiyarso, D; Sasmito, SD; Purbopuspito, J",,,Soil moisture; validation; satellite; analysis,WETNESS; IMPACT; SCALE,"Earth System Science Organization (ESSO); Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) - India; National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC)","[Unnikrishnan, C.

As the collection of such information requires field studies that are expensive, difficult, and time consuming, the prioritization of metrics can be of significant value. This study evaluates a number of metrics used to assess changes in forest structure and composition for a set of 59 forests in five countries - Kenya, India, Nepal, Uganda and USA. Changes in tree density are significantly positively correlated with changes in species richness, and changes in sapling/shrub density are significantly positively correlated with changes in species richness. Thus, rapid assessments of tree density change can be used to prioritize locations where there may be rapid deterioration in tree diversity, where the collection of detailed information on changes in species composition may be prioritized. Changes in tree density do not reflect changes in shrub and sapling density. The shrub and sapling layer appears to respond differently to human or natural disturbances compared to the tree layer, and may require separate assessment. Changes in tree DBH and tree height are not completely congruent, indicating that measurements of DBH and height may be required to accurately estimate changes in above ground carbon storage over time, for programs such as REDD that provide payment for carbon sequestration services.

Palaeoclimatic studies have indicated that the sholas have expanded in warmer climatic regimes and the grasslands during colder climates. Therefore during the present post-glacial climatic regime sholas may be in the expansion phase. Aims: We aimed to test if sholas are in an expansion phase; in particular, if smaller sholas could be at earlier successional stages than larger sholas. Methods: We enumerated all non-climbing plants (>= 1 cm dbh) in 18 shola patches ranging from 0.09 ha to 15 ha in area. We tested whether species richness, basal area, and proportion of large trees (>= 30 and >= 60 cm dbh) increased with shola size, and rare and 'ecotone' species decreased with shola size. Results: As predicted, species richness, basal area and the proportion of large trees (>= 60 cm dbh) increased with shola size, whereas the proportion of rare and 'ecotone' species decreased with shola size, and species in smaller sholas were a nested subset of those in larger sholas. Conclusions: These results suggest that shola forests are a highly structured plant community, possibly driven by succession.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2010.492843,2010,PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY,"Mohandass, D; Davidar, P",,,yield prediction; LISS-III; AWiFS; Punjab; wheat; remote sensing; yield,VEGETATION; INDEX,Punjab Agricultural University; Punjab Agricultural University; Punjab Agricultural University,"[Mukherjee, Joydeep; Gebru, Girmay; Bal, Santanu Kumar; Singh, Harpreet; Sidhu, Prabhjyot Kaur] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India; [Sood, Anil] Punjab Agr Univ, Punjab Remote Sensing Ctr, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India; [Mahey, Raj Kumar] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agron, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India","Mukherjee, J (corresponding author), Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Agr Meteorol, Ludhiana 141004, Punjab, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A3226,310,3227,Factors influencing seasonal and monthly changes in the group size of chital or axis deer in southern India,"Chital or axis deer (Axis axis) form fluid groups that change in size temporally and in relation to habitat. Predictions of hypotheses relating animal density, rainfall, habitat structure, and breeding seasonality, to changes in chital group size were assessed simultaneously using multiple regression models of monthly data collected over a 2 yr period in Guindy National Park, in southern India. Over 2,700 detections of chital groups were made during four seasons in three habitats (forest, scrubland and grassland). In scrubland and grassland, chital group size was positively related to animal density, which increased with rainfall. This suggests that in these habitats, chital density increases in relation to food availability, and group sizes increase due to higher encounter rate and fusion of groups. The density of chital in forest was inversely related to rainfall, but positively to the number of fruiting tree species and availability of fallen litter, their forage in this habitat. There was little change in mean group size in the forest, although chital density more than doubled during the dry season and summer. Dispersion of food items or the closed nature of the forest may preclude formation of larger groups. At low densities, group sizes in all three habitats were similar. Group sizes increased with chital density in scrubland and grassland, but more rapidly in the latter-leading to a positive relationship between openness and mean group size at higher densities. It is not clear, however, that this relationship is solely because of the influence of habitat structure. The rutting index (monthly percentage of adult males in hard antler) was positively related to mean group size in forest and scrubland, probably reflecting the increase in group size due to solitary males joining with females during the rut. The fission-fusion system of group formation in chital is thus interactively influenced by several factors. Aspects that need further study, such as interannual variability, are highlighted.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02704733,1997,JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES,"Raman, TRS",,,,,Zoological survey of India,"INST FRANCAISE PONDICHERRY,LAB PEDOL,PONDICHERRY 605001,INDIA; ZOOL SURVEY INDIA,HIGH ALTITUDE ZOOL FIELD STN,SOLAN 173212,HIMACHAL PRADES,INDIA",,,,,,,,,,,,

It was observed that all sites lost trees due to removal by people and mortality. Loss of trees was more in sites that are easily accessible and closer to human habitation. In spite of a decrease in tree density, an increase in basal area was observed in some forest plots, which could be on account of stimulatory growth of surviving trees. Decrease in basal area in other sites indicates greater human pressure and overexploitation of trees. Preponderance of lower girth class trees, and a unimodal reverse 'J-shaped' curve of density distribution as observed in majority of the sites in the benchmark year, was indicative of regenerating status of these forests. The decrease in number of species in all forest sites was due to indiscriminate removal of trees by people, without sparing species with only a few individuals, and also due to mortality of trees of rare species. Higher species richness and diversity in the lowest dbh class in most of the sites in the benchmark year is indicative of the existence of favorable conditions for sylvigenesis. The decrease in the similarity index suggests extirpation of species, favoring invasion and colonization by secondary species.

Results demonstrated that RhB was found in all samples at low concentrations (0.11-0.98 mu g/kg), indicating RhB contamination in capsicums is probably a ubiquitous phenomenon. In addition, studies into soils, roots, stems and leaves in Handan of Hebei province, China showed that the whole ecologic chain had been contaminated with RhB with the highest levels in leaves. The investigation into the agricultural environment in Handan of Hebei province and Korla of Xinjiang province, China demonstrated that the appearances of RhB contamination in the tested capsicums are mainly due to the agricultural materials contamination.

The present study attempted to assess the biomass and carbon stock of mangroves of Thalassery estuarine wetland of Kerala, south-west coast of India. We assessed the carbon stocks of three carbon pools viz., above-ground, below-ground (root) and sediment. A total of eight species of mangroves were recorded from the Thalassery estuarine wetland, and of these, Avicennia officinalis was the dominant species with an average tree density of 729.37 individuals ha(-1) and contributed most (45.05 +/- 23.79 t ha(-1)) to the total carbon. The overall mean above-ground biomass was 189.26 +/- 97.80 t ha(-1), while the overall mean root biomass was 83.06 +/- 40.48 t ha(-1). The estimated mean above-ground carbon was 94.63 +/- 48.90 t C ha(-1), while the mean carbon stock in root and sediment were 41.53 +/- 20.24 t C ha(-1) and 17.48 +/- 7.30 t C ha(-1), respectively. In the present study, the estimates of mean combined C-stocks in mangrove and sediment showed that the mangroves of Thalassery estuarine wetland stored 153.64 t C ha(-1) which was equivalent to 563.86 t CO2 ha(-1). The mangroves of Thalassery wetland cover an area of approximately 5.8 ha and thus it can be assumed that this wetland has the potential to sequester and store 891.11 t C, equivalent to an estimated amount of 3270.37 t CO2.

Twenty-six nest-site variables were recorded in each of 27 nest plots to evaluate variability of nest-site selection. Malabar Gray Hornbills selected nest trees of significantly larger diameter at breast height (DBH 60-89 cm), and greater height of the lowest Limb than the associated values from randomly chosen trees. The number of trees of 60-74 cm DBH class was significantly higher in the nest site plots than in the random plots. Most nests were in tall live trees and were formed primarily by heart rot where a branch had broken. Comparison of relative abundance of potential nest cavities and availability of trees in different DBH classes in belt transects indicates that more cavities were formed in trees of larger diameter. Density of potential nest cavities was 10/ha. Malabar Gray Hornbills consistently chose smaller trees than sympatric Great Hornbills (Buceros bicornis).

We report the estimates of forest carbon pool and its spatial distribution in the Indian forests for the years 1994 and 2010 at 51cm grid level. This study improves upon earlier spatial estimates of Indian forest biomass carbon by using data from a robustly designed National Forest Inventory (NFI). The realized sampling intensity has addressed the large heterogeneity of the Indian forest types and allowed the computation of 5 km grid level forest C, yielding a realistic estimate of forest biomass C in Indian forests. Forest cover density maps were intersected with 5 km mesh and estimates of forest area, forest carbon density for each Agro-ecological sub region and forest carbon pools were linked to the 5 km grid coverage of India. National forest carbon estimates for the years 1994 and 2010 are 3911.78 and 4368.03 TgC respectively, and these estimates showed a net increase of 456.25 TgC in 16 years. Uncertainty of the estimates has been addressed spatially. Mean forest carbon density increased from 61.14 Mg ha(-1) in 1994 to 64.08 Mg ha(-1) in 2010. C densities for dense and open forest in 1994 estimated as 77.08 and 38.47 Mg ha(-1) with total C pools of 2895.28 TgC and 1016.50 TgC which has increased to 80.24 Mg ha(-1) and 41.69 Mg ha(-1) with total C pools of 3176.48 TgC and 1191.55 TgC in 2010. This study provides the first 5 km level C analysis for Indian forests.

Forest biomass quantification is highly crucial for the maintenance of global carbon cycle. Hence, the accurate estimation of tree parameters is of utmost requirement nowadays. The hypothesis of this research is to formulate a volumetric equation which will be focussed on the structure of the tree and not the species. To serve this purpose, 13 plots were scanned in the Barkot forest range of Uttarakhand, India, and the plots were scanned using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS). The tree attribute such as radius of the stem and tree height were estimated using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm and line primitive vector, respectively. The correlation was established using multiple linear regression using the TLS derived tree parameters and field estimated tree parameters. The R2 obtained for field estimated biomass is 0.91 with radius and 0.73 with the tree height. The radius of the stem and tree height were used for the calculation of volume of all the trees and the R2 value obtained for field estimated volume and TLS derived volume is 0.95. Then the stem volume of the trees were calculated based on the new volume equation. The statistical analysis was done, and ANOVA test was performed indicating high F value (25.4) which shows that the regression model is significant. The predicted biomass correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.97) was obtained. It represents the significance of the model for the estimation of volume and biomass is high. The equation can be implemented in any forest type irrespective of the forest structure.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-4-W4-2022-133-2022,2022,17TH 3D GEOINFO CONFERENCE,"Singh, A; Kushwaha, SKP; Nandy, S; Padalia, H",,,Dust accumulation; Stone crusher plant; Woody plants; Leaves,LEAF STRUCTURE; VEGETATION,Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi,"[Rahul, Jitin] Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, New Delhi 110020, India","Rahul, J (corresponding author), Indraprastha Inst Informat Technol, New Delhi 110020, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, along tropical elevation gradients, frost may influence woody plant community structure by filtering out lowland tropical clades and allowing extra-tropical lineages to establish at higher elevations. Here we assess the extent to which frost and freezing temperatures influence the taxonomic and phylogenetic structure of naturally patchy evergreen forests (locally known as shola ) along a mid-upper montane elevation gradient in the Western Ghats, India. Specifically, we examine the role of large-scale macroclimate and factors affecting local microclimates, including shola patch size and distance from shola edge, in driving shola metacommunity structure. We find that the shola metacommunity shows phylogenetic overdispersion with elevation, with greater representation of extra-tropical lineages above 2000 m, and marked turnover in taxonomic composition of shola woody communities near the frost-affected forest edge above 2000 m, from those below 2000 m. Both minimum winter temperature and patch size were equally important in determining metacommunity structure, with plots inside very large sholas dominated by older tropical lineages, with many endemics. Phylogenetic overdispersion in the upper montane shola metacommunity thus resulted from tropical lineages persisting in the interiors of large closed frost-free sholas, where their regeneration niche has been preserved over time.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.0038,2022,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Das, AA; Ratnam, J",,,Biomass productivity; GHG emission; Microbial resilience; Earthworm diversity; Net carbon balance; Multifunctionality composite index,ORGANIC-MATTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CARBON; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; EARTHWORM; ENERGY; CONSERVATION; DEGRADATION; CHALLENGES,Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute,"[Biswas, Benukar; Bhowmick, Udayan Rudra; Dhara, Pratap Kumar; Ghosh (Lkn), Dipak Kumar; Sarkar, Arindam; Mondal, Mousumi; Adhikary, Saju; Kanthal, Sahely] Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur 741252, West Bengal, India; [Chakraborty, Debashis; Patra, Kiranmay] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Timsina, Jagadish] Global Evergreening Alliance, 1 Vis Dr,East Burwood, Melbourne, Vic 3151, Australia; [Sarkar, Sukamal] Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educ & Res Inst, Sch Agr & Rural Dev, Kolkata 700103, India; [Parsad, Rajender] ICAR Indian Agr Stat Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Ray, Bikash Ranjan] Govt West Bengal, Directorate Agr, Kolkata 1, West Bengal, India; [Timsina, Jagadish] Inst Study & Dev Worldwide, 8-45 Henley Rd,Homebush West, Sydney, NSW 2140, Australia","Biswas, B (corresponding author), Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur 741252, West Bengal, India.","Bidhan Chandra Krishi Visvavidyalaya (state agricultural university of West Bengal, India); Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Government of West Bengal; Microbiology Department of Kalyani University, Zoological Survey India",,,,,,,,,,

North-East India (NEI) region, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, covers 17.2 million ha of land under forests, constituting ~25% of India's total forest area. The population-driven abrupt decline of the fallow period's duration has aggravated soil erosion, depletion of nutrients, decreased productivity, reduced biodiversity, and weakening of essential ecosystem services. Therefore, the present research aims to explore whether the duration of the fallow period of up to 20-years can restore diversity of tree species, biomass carbon, and ecosystem carbon stock equivalent to those under natural forests. Based on the accessibility and availability of the fallow stands, three categories were selected for the study (1–2, 5–8, and 15–20 years), and these were replicated eight times for each age group. While the 20-years of fallow increased tree diversity, it was still 22% lower than that of the natural forest. Similarly, a 2.7-fold increase in biomass carbon storage was observed with an increase in the fallow period from 5–8-years (33.4 Mg ha−1) to 15–20-years (92.9 Mg ha−1), yet the latter was 40% lower than that under the natural forests. The very labile and labile carbon stocks decreased with increase in the fallow period. In contrast, the less labile and non-labile carbon stocks increased with increase in the fallow age. Because of the absence of a long fallow management system in the region, and to minimize the risks of ecosystem carbon degradation, adopting an integrated approach is recommended to enhance the ecological integrity of the degraded lands under shifting cultivation while also improving the livelihood of the shifting cultivators.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2021.100122,2021,ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS,"Nath, PC; Nath, AJ; Reang, D; Lal, R; Das, AK",,,Microbial indices; Soil enzymes; Microbial biomass; Forest fire; Pine forest; Oak forest,ORGANIC-MATTER; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; EXTRACTION METHOD; MEDIUM-TERM; WILDFIRE; SEVERITY; NITROGEN; ECOSYSTEMS; DIVERSITY; NUTRIENTS,Doon University,"[Singh, Devanshi; Sharma, Priyanka; Kumar, Ujjwal; Daverey, Achlesh; Arunachalam, Kusum] Doon Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dehra Dun 248012, Uttarakhand, India","Kumar, U; Daverey, A; Arunachalam, K (corresponding author), Doon Univ, Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Dehra Dun 248012, Uttarakhand, India.","Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC), India",gold,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally such studies have focused on the species composition of communities, but researchers are becoming increasingly interested in analyzing the phylogenetic composition in the hope of achieving mechanistic insights into community structure. To date many metrics of phylogenetic beta diversity have been published, but few empirical studies have been published.

Three pairs of adjacent subplors had an equal number of species and for one pair tree density matched. In the others the difference in species richness ranged from one to 23 species ha(-1), while tree density ranged from 2 to 192 trees ha(-1). In the majority of subplots the observed variation in tree species richness, density, and basal area (in all the subplots) exhibited a random pattern at a 100m(2) scale. A total of 67% to 86% of species in each 1-ha subplot showed a random distributional pattern. There was no significant difference in species and family diversity indices between the thirty 1-ha subplots. The species-area curve did not stabilize in any of the 30 subplots at the 1-ha scale. Of the total species obtained in each subplot, 50% were captured within a 0.2 ha and 80% within a 0.5 ha scale. Principal component analysis, using the abundance of the 20 top-ranked species of each 1-ha subplot, categorized the subplots into three clusters excluding ha 4 and 5. Spearman coefficient of rank correlation analysis displayed the variation in species richness between subplots, which could partially be explained by the dominance of a few species. The size class frequency distribution of each subplot showed the classic, nearly negative exponential pattern.

This study in a biodiversity hotspot and endemic bird area, the Western Ghats mountains of India, examined the effects of habitat structure, floristics, and adjacent habitats on bird communities in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and tropical rainforest fragments. Habitat and birds were sampled in 13 sites: six fragments (three relatively isolated and three with canopy connectivity with adjoining shade-coffee plantations and forests), six plantations differing in canopy tree species composition (five coffee and one cardamom), and one undisturbed primary rainforest control site in the Anamalai hills. Around 3300 detections of 6000 individual birds belonging to 106 species were obtained. The coffee plantations were poorer than rainforest in rainforest bird species, particularly endemic species, but the rustic cardamom plantation with diverse, native rainforest shade trees, had bird species richness and abundance comparable to primary rainforest. Plantations and fragments that adjoined habitats providing greater tree canopy connectivity supported more rainforest and fewer open-forest bird species and individuals than sites that lacked such connectivity. These effects were mediated by strong positive effects of vegetation structure, particularly woody plant variables, cane, and bamboo, on bird community structure. Bird community composition was however positively correlated only to floristic (tree species) composition of sites. The maintenance or restoration of habitat structure and (shade) tree species composition in shade-coffee and cardamom plantations and rainforest fragments can aid in rainforest bird conservation in the regional landscape.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-005-2352-5,2006,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,"Raman, TRS",,,KIDA; metal contamination; toxicity; risk assessment; pathway; Hyderabad; India,SOIL; LEAD,"Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT); Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University - Hyderabad; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI); Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, NGI","Indian Inst Chem Technol, Analyt Chem & Environm Sci Div, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; Jawaharlal Nehru Technol Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; Natl Geophys Res Inst, Geochem Div, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India; Norwegian Geotech Inst, Oslo, Norway","Sekhar, KC (corresponding author), Def Res & Dev Org, Analyt Chem Grp, Def Met Res Lab, Hyderabad 500058, Andhra Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

A 1-ha plot was inventoried in 1992 and was recensused in 2002. During the 10-year interval tree taxa diversity as well as stand density increased, but the basal area value decreased. Tree species richness increased by 21% (from 24 to 29 species) by an addition of eight species and local extinction of three species. The tree density increased just by eight individuals (from 1330 stems ha(-1) in 1992 to 1338 ha(-1) in 2002), but the basal area decreased by 8% (from 37.5 to 34.5 m(2) ha(-1)). Many species (11 numbers) have increased in abundance rather than decreased. Many surviving species seem to have considerable stability in abundance at the local scale. The density of smaller stems (10-29 cm gbh) increased by 15.3%, while that of the larger trees decreased drastically (81.6%). Ninety percent of the missing stems were from the middlestorey of the forest. Tree density changes among the three ecological guilds revealed a decrease in stem density and an increase in basal area in the lowerstorey; while the middlestorey exhibited a reverse trend.

In this study, we have used inventory data from seedlings to canopy level to assess the impact of both biotic and abiotic disturbances on structure, composition, and regeneration potential of the Fagaceae trees of these forests. Fagaceae trees are considered as the keystone species in these forests due to their regional dominance and their importance as a fuel wood source, and also because they form an important component of climax community in these forests. Unfortunately, these forests are highly degraded and fragmented due to anthropogenic disturbances. We have assessed, for the first time, the restoration potential (i.e., capacity to naturally regenerate and sustain desired forest structure) of Fagaceae species in the genera Lithocarpus Blume, Castanopsis (D. Don) Spach, and Quercus Linn. We also evaluated how biotic and abiotic factors, as well as anthropogenic disturbances, influence the restoration potential of these species in six fragmented forest patches located along an elevational gradient on south-facing slopes in the Khasi Hills, Meghalaya. Fagaceae was the most dominant family at all sites except one site (Laitkynsew), where it was co-dominant with Lauraceae. Fagaceae forests have shown high diversity and community assemblages. Fagaceae species had high levels of natural regeneration (i.e., seedlings and saplings) but low recruitment to large trees (diameter at breast height or DBH â‰¥ 10 cm) at all sites. The ability to sprout was higher in Fagaceae tree species than non-Fagaceae tree species. We have shown that human disturbance and structural diversity were positively related to regeneration of Fagaceae tree species due to high sprouting. However, with increasing human disturbance, recruitment of saplings and pole-sized trees to mature trees hampered the resulting proportion of mature Fagaceae tree species.

We encountered 2075 woody individuals of 70 species within a transect (2000 m-3636 m asl). The entire forest regime reflected a dominance of young trees and the species richness showed a negative correlation with the altitude. Climatic variables (actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration and moisture index) are the measures of available environmental energies which drive the final shape of forest community structure.

However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sires, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber Sorest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species.

There have been few comprehensive assessments of recovery following restoration in fragmented forest landscapes, and the efficacy of active versus passive (i.e., natural regeneration) restoration remains unclear. We examined 11 indicators of forest structure, tree diversity and composition (adult and sapling), and aboveground carbon storage in 25 pairs of actively restored (AR; 7-15 yr after weed removal and mixed-native tree species planting) and naturally regenerating (NR) plots within degraded rainforest fragments, and in 17 less-disturbed benchmark (BM) rainforest plots in the Western Ghats, India. We assessed the effects of active restoration on the 11 indicators and tested the hypothesis that the effects of active restoration increase with isolation from contiguous and relatively intact rainforests. Active restoration significantly increased canopy cover, adult tree and sapling density, adult and sapling species density (overall and late-successional), compositional similarity to benchmarks, and aboveground carbon storage, which recovered 14-82% toward BM targets relative to NR baselines. By contrast, tree height-diameter ratios and the proportion of native saplings did not recover consistently in actively restored forests. The effects of active restoration on canopy cover, species density (adult), late-successional species density (adult and sapling), and species composition, but not carbon storage, increased with isolation across the fragmented landscape. Our findings show that active restoration can promote recovery of forest structure, composition, and carbon storage within 7-15 yr of restoration in degraded tropical rainforest fragments, although the benefits of active over passive restoration across fragmented landscapes would depend on indicator type and may increase with site isolation. These findings on early stages of recovery suggest that active restoration in ubiquitous fragmented landscapes of the tropics could complement passive restoration of degraded forests in less fragmented landscapes, and protection of intact forests, as a key strategy for conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2860,2019,ECOSPHERE,"Osuri, AM; Kasinathan, S; Siddhartha, MK; Mudappa, D; Raman, TRS",,,Mangifera indica; genic simple sequences repeat; genetic diversity; principal coordinate analysis; AMOVA,SOFTWARE,Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Research Centre on Seed Spices; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Institute For Plant Biotechnology (NIPB),"[Lai, S.; Singh, A.

A maximum likelihood classifier was used to generate a supervised classification into land-cover types and the vegetation types within the forested area. The preparation of training data sets used thematic maps of the area, and knowledge accruing from extensive personal field visits. Sample field plots were located at 30 different places in the Sanctuary for classification accuracy assessment. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was also computed from LISS-III satellite imagery. A digital elevation model (DEM) of the Sanctuary was generated using a GIS. The DEM was used to test the hypothesis that its joint use with the satellite data would increase classification accuracy. This proved to be the case. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed between spectral and DEM variables to cross-check the results. In the example used, that of the rugged terrain in mountainous parts of northeast India, such integration of satellite land-cover data and DEM information appears to be a necessity in improved land-cover mapping for resource planning and utilization.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133309351048,2009,PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT,"Reddy, MB; Blah, B",,,Forest conservation; forest inventory; India; Nilgiri Hills; plant diversity; shola forest; tropical montane forest; Western Ghats,WESTERN-GHATS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; RAIN-FORESTS; SITES; PLOTS; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATION; INVENTORY; RESERVE; HILLS,Pondicherry University,"[Mohandass, D.; Davidar, Priya] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India","Davidar, P (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of more number of stems and trees as well as species was observed in minor forests of the evergreen forest zone. Higher species richness and basal area were observed in reserve forests, perhaps as a result of restricted access. Occurrence of more number of species over ten years In minor forests of moist deciduous zone indicates opening of canopy, favouring growth of other species. Regeneration of existing species in the study plot is suggestive of the site potentiality to retain its physiognomic status. Appearance of species with different physiognomic characters and reduction in basal area suggest greater extraction pressure, implying the deteriorating vegetation status.

,,,A1855,357,1856,"Diversity, distribution and vegetative structure of mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India","The present study was carried out to determine the diversity, distribution and vegetative structure of mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). The results suggest that mangroves of the ANI consist of 38 mangrove species belonging to 12 families and 19 genera, which includes 4 hybrids and 34 species. In other words, about 50% of the global mangrove species are present in ANI. Andaman Islands have 35 species and Nicobar Islands have 21 mangrove species. The average tree density in ANI is 1746/per hectare and varies from 487 to 2383 per hectare. The Shannon diversity index for the whole ANI is 2.94 and Simpson index is 0.07. Family Rhizophoraceae constitutes an important vegetative component in the mangroves of the ANI followed by Acanthaceae, Lythraceae and Malvaceae. Rhizophora spp. constitutes 19% of the Important Value Index (IVI) and R. apiculata is dominant in ANI. Among the eight forest divisions, mangrove diversity is high in South Andaman (30 species) followed by Middle Andaman (28), Mayabunder (25), Diglipur (25), Nicobar (21), Little Andaman (20), Havelock (20) and Baratang (20). The average mangrove plant density and Shannon diversity index (H') is high in Middle Andaman (2101/hectare; H' = 2.93). Species richness index (d') is high in South Andaman (3.32). Evenness index (J') is high in Little Andaman (0.92). Simpson dominance index (D) ranged between 0.07-0.1, and this agrees with the high diversity in mangroves of ANI. In all the divisions Rhizophora spp. constitutes a major vegetative component except, Diglipur and Nicobar. In Diglipur Bruguiera spp. are dominant, while in Nicobar Sonneratia spp. are dominant. The low similarity value of the Nicobar division with other divisions indicates the difference in floristic structure of mangroves of the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands.

Grass, and herbaceous plant biomass, number of cattle dung piles, number of woody stems available and damaged by human activities and weed biomass were assessed at different proximity along transects radiating from village-forest boundary to forest interior to measure the ecological impact of livestock grazing and fire wood collection. The grass biomass was positively correlated to overgrazing indicating the adverse effect on natural vegetation by cattle. Woodcutting was intense along the forest boundary and significantly declined as distance increased. Similarly, weed biomass and number of thorny species declined positively with proximity from village-forest boundary and the weed biomass was significantly higher in the pastoral sites compared to residential sites. The results suggest that human impact adversely affects natural vegetation and promotes weed proliferation in forest areas adjoining human settlements in the ecologically important Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Continued anthropogenic pressure could cause reduction in fodder availability to large herbivores like elephants, which in turn leads to an increase in human-elephant conflict.

The present paper synthesizes the first report related to the documentation and conservation of ethnomedicinal plants of Chandauli district and their socio-economic relationship with the forests and its resources. Materials and methods: Ethnobotanical data were collected using semi-structured interviews, field observations, preference and direct matrix ranking with traditional medicine practitioners. Results: The use of 40 medicinal plants belonging to 27 families was documented in the tribal communities of Chandauli district in India. These species were used in combination of some exotic species such as Foeniculum vulgare. Prosopis spicigera, Crataeva nurvala, Curcuma longa, Punica granatum, Aloe vera, Cocos nucifera, Ocimum sanctum and Allium cepa and some medicinal stones, minerals, salts. etc. Most of the plants (94.6%) were reportedly used to treat human diseases. Conclusions: Documenting the eroding plants and associated indigenous knowledge can be used as a basis for developing management plans for conservation and sustainable use of medicinal plants in the area. The principal threatening factors reported were deforestation (90%). agricultural expansion (85%) and overgrazing (53%). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ground data on phyto-sociology and Leaf Area Index (LAI) over the study area was collected in 23 sampling points (20m x 20m) over the study area. Phyto-sociological data collected over the study area was used to compute plot-wise biometric parameters like basal area, volume, stem density and dominant height. ENVISAT ASAR data covering the study area, pertaining to 24 November 2005, has been geo-referenced and digital number (DN) values were converted to radar backscatter values. Regression analysis between backscatter and the retrieved biometric variables has been done to explain the relationships between SAR backscatter and forest parameters. Analysis showed a significant correlation between backscatter and biometric parameters and backscatter values typically increased with increase in basal area, volume, stem density and dominant height. The scatter observed between ASAR backscatter and stem density, basal area and dominant height suggested limitation of C-band data in estimating biometric variables in heterogeneous forest systems. Further, ASAR data was used in conjunction with Indian Remote sensing Satellite (IRS-P6)-Linear Imaging Self Scanner (LISS) III data of 16 October 2004 to classify the study area into different land use/land cover (LU/LC) classes. Various texture and adaptive filters were applied on ASAR image to reduce speckle noise and enhance image features. An attempt is made to merge ASAR image with LISS-III to enhance feature discrimination. Training sets corresponding to the ground data have been used to derive confusion matrices for the ASAR and LISS-III images. Results suggested better discrimination of vegetation types in the merged data suggesting the possible use of ASAR data in forest type discrimination.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1080/01431160701253295,2007,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING,"Chand, TRK; Badarinath, KVS",,,,PLANTS,University of Queensland; University of Queensland; BSES Limited,"Univ Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Sugar Ind Innovat Biotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; Univ Queensland, Australian Inst Bioengn & Nanotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; BSES Ltd, Indooroopilly, Qld 4068, Australia","Brumbley, SM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Cooperat Res Ctr Sugar Ind Innovat Biotechnol, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,

The accumulated data will become increasingly important in the context of environmental modelling and climate change, especially if the plots and data can be maintained and/or revived. This contribution presents the history and current state of forest research plots in India, including details of locations and re-measurements. We provide a brief introduction of the National Forest Inventory (NFI), Preservation Plots in natural forests, the 50-ha Mudumalai Forest Dynamics Plot as part of the Centre for Tropical Forest Science and Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories network (CTFS-SIGEO), and research plots established in plantations for tree growth studies and modelling. We also present some methodological details including assessment and analysis for two types of observational studies, the Tree Count Plots (TCP) and Tree Re-measurement Plots (TRP).

In the moist deciduous forest very fine root biomass was significantly higher under the open canopies (309 g m(-2)) than in the closed canopies (222 g m(-2)). While in the semi-evergreen and evergreen forest ecosystems closed canopies (Site II: 318, Site III: 315 and Site IV: 275 g m(-2)) were comparatively higher in very fine root biomass than the open canopies (264, 278 and 239 g m-2). A similar trend was observed in the fine root productivity also. Under the closed canopies, total fine root standing crop biomass was significantly higher under the evergreen forest (1847-2021 g m(-2)) compared with others (1081 g m(-2) and 1298 g m(-2)). Root production and standing crop biomass showed a seasonal pattern of maximum during the rainy season and minimum in the dry season. Necromass fraction ranged between 52-132 g m(-2) and the maximum was in the dry period. Localized disturbances such as canopy openings contributed towards the reduction of fine root biomass. Due to the annual wild fire and the consequent grass community dominance in the moist deciduous forest (Site I), greater standing crop of very fine root biomass and net primary productivity was observed. Further, the study revealed that the fine root biomass and production increased significantly due to litter accumulation (P < 0.05) and the soil moisture (P < 0.01) at the ground level.

Maximum fine and coarse root mass of P. kesiya, and fine root and rhizome mass of the ground vegetation were recorded during the rainy season. The contribution of the tree fine roots in 0-10 cm soil layer declined from 51% in the 6-year old stand to about 33% in the older stands. The major proportion (63-88%) of herbaceous fine root and rhizome mass was concentrated in this soil layer in all the three stands. The majority (36-57%) of tree coarse roots were present in the 10-20 cm layer in all the stands. The biomass and necromass values in the case of fine roots were more or less equal in a given stand, but the coarse roots had 5 to 9 times more live than the dead mass. The proportion of herbaceous fine root mass to the total fine root mass declined from 54% in the 6-year old stand to 30-32% in the 15- and 23-year old stands. The mean total fine root mass (pine + herbaceous species) decreased from 417 g m(-2) in the 6-year old stand to 302 in 15-year and 322 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand. Annual fine root production showed a marked decrease from 1055 g m(-2) in the 6-year old stand to 743 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand, but coarse root production increased from 169 g m(-2) in the 6-year to 466 g m(-2) in the 23-year old stand; the total root production thus remained approximately constant.

A detailed study was carried out to assess the productivity, species richness and diversity of grasses of the grasslands in different hill agro-ecosystems of Kangra district of IIimachal Pradesh in western Himalaya. Saccharuin spontaneum (low hills), Chtysopogon echinulatus (mid hills) and Festuca spp. (high hills) were observed as the most dominant species in hill agro-ecosystems. Productivity assessment was done at five locations, viz. open forest area; enclosed forest area; community land; farmers' field; and wasteland in each hill zone. High species richness and diversity was observed in mid hill zone as compared to low and high hills. The mean production level was recorded highest in low hills closely followed by mid hills; much less in high hills. Amongst the land-use systems. highest biomass production was recorded at farmers' field followed by community land and least in wasteland situation. The average herbage production obtained through six cuts at periodic intervals (March to December) was 3,202 DM kg/ha, while in single harvest it was 2.249 DM kg/ba (low-hill conditions); 2,893 and 1.924 DM kg/ha (mid-hill conditions) and 1,399 and 850 DM kg/ha (high-hill conditions), respectively. Averaged over the different locations, 6.01, 6.64 and 10.87% crude protein (CP) was observed (in multicut situation) in low, mid and high hills respectively.

We focus on how seed predation may modify seed deposition patterns and affect the abundance and dispersion of adult trees in a tropical forest in India. Using plots across a range of seed densities, we examined whether seed predation levels by terrestrial rodents varied across six large-seeded, bird-dispersed tree species. Since inter-specific variation in density-dependent seed mortality may have downstream effects on recruitment and adult tree stages, we determined recruitment patterns close to and away from parent trees, along with adult tree abundance and dispersion patterns. Four species (Canarium resiniferum, Dysoxylum binectariferum, Horsfieldia kingii, and Prunus ceylanica) showed high predation levels (78.5-98.7%) and increased mortality with increasing seed density, while two species, Chisocheton cumingianus and Polyalthia simiarum, showed significantly lower seed predation levels and weak density-dependent mortality. The latter two species also had the highest recruitment near parent trees, with most abundant and aggregated adults. The four species that had high seed mortality had low recruitment under parent trees, were rare, and had more spaced adult tree dispersion. Biotic dispersal may be vital for species that suffer density-dependent mortality factors under parent trees. In tropical forests where large vertebrate seed dispersers but not seed predators are hunted, differences in seed vulnerability to rodent seed predation and density-dependent mortality can affect forest structure and composition.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2252-9,2012,OECOLOGIA,"Velho, N; Isvaran, K; Datta, A",,,Phenology; MTCI; MERIS; Fourier; Double logistic; Asymmetric Gaussian; Whittaker smoother; Filter techniques,CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOURIER-ANALYSIS; PLANT PHENOLOGY; HIGH-LATITUDES; MODIS; INDIA; COVER; MERIS; VARIABILITY; COMPOSITE,"Birla Institute of Technology Mesra; University of Southampton; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","[Jeganathan, C.] BIT, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India; [Atkinson, Peter M.; Dash, Jadu] Univ Southampton, Global Environm Change & Earth Observat Res Grp, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Atzberger, Clement] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Inst Surveying Remote Sensing & Land Informat, Vienna, Austria","Jeganathan, C (corresponding author), BIT, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Jharkhand, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,A3210,371,3211,"Conservation status of forests and wildlife in the Eastern Ghats, India","The Eastern Ghats (EGs) comprise a chain of ancient low hills in the state of Andhra Pradesh adjoining the east coast of India. These hill ranges are well known for a rich array of tropical forests with great conservation significance which support large human populations. A series of protected areas (PAs) have been established by the government along these ranges to conserve the regional biodiversity, but their effectiveness is often questionable. In order to assess the ecological status of the forests both within and outside the PAs and to assess the impacts of ongoing forestry practices a survey was conducted along the EGs. Plant species richness, and density of shrubs and trees, were estimated along disturbance gradients (core, buffer and fringe situations) using random plots of 10-m radius for trees, and 5-m radius (nested) plots for shrubs and saplings. Indirect evidence (spoor) of domestic and wild animals was recorded within the sample plots to compare habitat use by the animals. Srivenkateshwara National Park in the Seshachalam Hills, Gundlabrahmeshwaram Sanctuary in Nallamalais and some parts of Srisailam-Nagarjunasagar Tiger Reserve, had the least degraded forests due to their PA status. However, collection of non-timber forest products, bamboo harvesting and livestock grazing continues in all areas irrespective of legal status. All bamboo areas have been heavily worked. It is recommended that bamboo working should be stopped in core areas of the PAs and reduced from nine to six months (October to March) in the buffer zones. Summer is a period of potential water shortage for wild animals and bamboo workers' camps near water courses may affect habitat use by these species. The proposed Gudem Maripakhala Sanctuary, well known for its biogeographical value and diverse nora, is seriously threatened as a result of to extensive 'podu' (slash and burn) cultivation. It is suggested that an integrated approach to biodiversity conservation and better agricultural practices, should be adopted in this area.

The present study aimed to assess the community attributes, viz., structure, composition and diversity in the moist and dry sal (Shorea robusta) forests in the West Bengal province of India and compare them with the other sal forests of India. The phytosociological data from these forests were quantitatively analysed to work out the species richness, diversity, evenness, dominance, importance value, stand density and the basal area. The analysis showed that plant richness and diversity in moist sal forests of northern West Bengal are higher than the dry sal forests of south-west Bengal; a total of 134 tree (cbh a parts per thousand yen30 cm), 113 shrub and 230 herb species were recorded in the moist sal forest compared to 35 tree, 41 shrub and 96 herb species in dry sal forest. Papilionaceae was observed to be the dominant family. Dry sal forests had higher tree dominance (0.81) and stand density (1,006 stems ha(-1)) but lower basal area (19.62 m(2)ha(-1)) while moist sal forest had lower tree dominance (0.18) and stand density (438 stems ha(-1)) but higher basal area (56.52 m(2)ha(-1)). Tree species richness and stem density across girth classes in both the types decreased from the smallest to largest trees, while the occurrence rate of species increased with increase in girth class. A t-test showed significant differences in species richness, basal area and the stand density at 95% confidence level (p = < 0.05) in the two forest types. The CCA indicated very low overall match (canonical correlation value = 0.40) between the two sets of variables from moist and dry sal types.

Our results showed that the sacred forest had a greater species richness, density and diversity compared to the wildlife sanctuary. The density in different diameter classes showed that the sacred forest is regenerating with a good regeneration potential, but the wildlife sanctuary had a poor regeneration potential with lower numbers of saplings than adults. However, the biomass and carbon content of the wildlife sanctuary were higher than in the sacred forest. This may be due to the presence of a higher proportion of old trees in the wildlife sanctuary compared to the sacred forest.

The role of mangrove forests in mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation is well recognized. The present field study aimed to estimate the carbon stocks of Mahanadi Mangrove Wetland (MMW), east coast of India. Carbon stocks were estimated in vegetation and soil of natural mangrove forest stands and new mangrove plantation stands. The mean of carbon stock in natural stands was 143.4 +/- 8.2 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.1 +/- 8.9 and soil 54.3 +/- 3.0 Mg C ha(-1)) and plantation at 151.5 +/- 7.9 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 90.6 +/- 16.2 and soil 60.9 +/- 5.6 Mg C ha(-1)). The mean overall C-stock of natural stands and plantations was 147.0 +/- 8.1 Mg C ha(-1) (vegetation 89.4 +/- 7.6 and soil 57.6 +/- 3.2 Mg C ha(-1)), which is 1.6 times higher than that in forests of Odisha. A positive correlation (r = 0.87) was found between vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in the surface soil (0-30 cm), indicating the role of vegetation in building surface soil/sediment organic carbon. The 6651 ha of mangrove forests in the MMW is estimated to store 0.98 Mt of C, which is equivalent to 3.59 Mt of CO(2)e. The present study reveals that MMW stores substantial amount of atmospheric carbon and therefore needs to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as increase carbon storage.

Purulia is a part of the biogeographic zone Deccan Peninsula Chhotonagpur. The authors have reported the use of medicinal plants by nine tribes of the district against various gastrointestinal disorders. Materials and methods: Semi structured questionnaire was used during the interview with the informants having traditional botanical knowledge. Bhumijs, Birhor, Gond, Ho, Kharia, Mal Pahariya, Mundas, Oraon and Santhali represent the various aboriginal groups present in the district. The use of medicinal plants were documented using an interview data sheet mentioning the names, age, profession and gender of the informants and scientific and vernacular names, families, part(s) used, disease(s) treated, method of preparation, mode of administration of the botanicals and the preparations. Results: A total number of 56 plants belonging to 29 families have been reported to be used against different types of gastrointestinal disorders viz, indigestion, stomach pain, vomiting tendency, constipation, piles, diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, loss of appetite, liver complaints, intestinal worms etc. Fabaceae and Apocynaceae were found to be the dominant families of medicinal plants used to treat such ailments. Conclusion: Age, gender, literacy and profession of the aboriginals were found to be the significant factors when the traditional knowledge of medicinal botanicals was concerned. Due to urbanization and loss of biodiversity, the authors have noted a significant decrease in the ethnic knowledge as well as the botanicals. Preservation of folklore should be given utmost importance in this region to prevent the rapid loss of ethnobotanical wealth. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

,,,A2572,378,2573,"Relationship between annual rainfall and tree mortality in a tropical dry forest: Results of a 19-year study at Mudumalai, southern India","Variability in rainfall is known to be a major influence on the dynamics of tropical forests, especially rates and patterns of tree mortality. In tropical dry forests a number of contributing factors to tree mortality, including dry season fire and herbivory by large herbivorous mammals, could be related to rainfall patterns, while loss of water potential in trees during the dry season or a wet season drought could also result in enhanced rates of death. While tree mortality as influenced by severe drought has been examined in tropical wet forests there is insufficient understanding of this process in tropical dry forests. We examined these causal factors in relation to inter-annual differences in rainfall in causing tree mortality within a 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot located in the tropical dry deciduous forests of Mudumalai, southern India, that has been monitored annually since 1988. Over a 19-year period (1988-2007) mean annual mortality rate of all stems >1 cm dbh was 6.9 +/- 4.6% (range = 1.5-17.5%); mortality rates broadly declined from the smaller to the larger size classes with the rates in stems >30 cm dbh being among the lowest recorded in tropical forest globally. Fire was the main agent of mortality in stems 1-5 cm dbh, elephant-herbivory in stems 5-10 cm dbh, and other natural causes in stems > 10 cm dbh. Elephant-related mortality did not show any relationship to rainfall. On the other hand, fire-related mortality was significantly negatively correlated to quantity of rainfall during the preceding year. Mortality due to other causes in the larger stem sizes was significantly negatively correlated to rainfall with a 2-3-year lag, suggesting that water deficit from mild or prolonged drought enhanced the risk of death but only with a time lag that was greater than similar lags in tree mortality observed in other forest types. In this respect, tropical dry forests growing in regions of high rainfall variability may have evolved greater resistance to rainfall deficit as compared to tropical moist or temperate forests but are still vulnerable to drought-related mortality.

Soppinabetta forests are farmer-managed, fragmented evergreen forests of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India. We hypothesized that these forests have immense importance in conservation of epiphytic orchid flora, although management intensity may differentially affect the diversity. Orchid diversity of the Soppinabetta forests of two degrees of management (sustained Soppinabetta, N = 11; degraded Soppinabetta, N = 4) has been compared with protected reserve forest fragments (N = 6). A total of 3537 orchid individuals of 41 species were recorded from 1.05 ha area; 39 species were found in the Soppinabetta forests. Orchid species richness was highest in sustained Soppinabetta forests (26.2) compared to degraded Soppinabetta (23) and reserve forest fragments (20.5). Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed that the orchid community of the degraded Soppinabetta was distinct. It was found that even when the total alpha diversity was preserved, a shift in the orchid species can take place with anthropogenic disturbance. About 21% of the overall surveyed trees were phorophytes. Mean phorophytes ranged between 15% and 46.5% among three forest types. Compositional variation of phorophyte trees had little effect on orchid diversity of the fragments. The present study shows that the deficiency of properly protected reserve forests can be compensated by the farmer-managed local Soppinabetta forests for epiphytic orchid conservation in the region.

,,,A0571,380,572,Site quality and vegetation biomass in the tropical Sal mixed deciduous forest of Central India,"opical Sal forests are gaining wide recognitions due to its multifarious significance. An estimation of vegetational structure and biomass would be helpful for evaluating both productivity and sustainability of the forest ecosystems. Information regarding vegetational biomass, litter mass and fine root biomass, and overall dry matter dynamics are very limited. Therefore, the present work deals the vegetation biomass influenced by four different site quality of Sal dominating tropical deciduous forest of Chhattisgarh, India. The current study provides a framework under which all vegetational attributes can be quantified under varying site quality which is modified by different seasons. Our study revealed a significant increase in vegetational attributes and biomass as per increasing quality of sites. The density value (individuals/ha) and basal area (m2/ha) of tree, sapling and seedling in different sites were ranged from 710 to 1010, 2000 to 2500, 9750 to 14,500 and 33.5 to 46.8, 0.32 to 0.33, 17.96 to 21.43, respectively. The total biomass varied from 187.39 to 383.46 t ha−1. The fine root and forest floor biomass varied between 2.44 and 4.20 t ha−1, and 2.32 and 2.83 t ha−1, respectively among different sites and seasons. The total litter fall varied from 4.18 to 5.69 t ha−1 yr−1 across the site quality. It reflected that highest value of forest floor, litter floor and fine root biomass were seen in site quality (SQ) SQ-I followed by SQ-II, SQ-III and SQ-IV, respectively in different seasons. A great synergy exists among site quality, stand structure and biomass which surely affect ecosystem structure and its functions. Seasonal impacts are another factor that regulates vegetational statistics, forest floor, fine roots and pattern of litterfall in varying site qualities.

Such data are necessary for ecosystem conservation of the under-studied Eastern Ghats, as extensive forests here have already been converted to coffee and orange plantations and the landscape changed due to aluminium ore mining and quarrying. Four 1-ha plots were established in Sanyasimalai (SM) reserve forest of the Shervarayan hills, one plot (SM1) located close to mining and quarrying area, two other contiguous plots (SM2 and SM3) located in selective felling area and the fourth (SM4) in a relatively undisturbed forest. These are 1 to 4 km apart in the same semi-evergreen forest tract. In the four study plots a total of 3260 stems (mean density 815 ha(-1)) covering 80 species in 71 genera and 44 plant families were recorded. Species richness was greatest in the undisturbed plot SM4 (50), while lowest (33) in the selectively felled site SM2. The forest stand (SM4) was also denser (986 stems ha(-1)) and more voluminous (basal area 44.3 m(2) ha(-1) as compared with the site mean of 35 m(2) ha(-1)) than the other plots. Four trees, Chionanthus paniculata, Syzygium cumini, Canthium dicoccum and Ligustrum perrottetii dominated the stand, collectively contributing to >50 % of the total density. Species richness and stand density decreased with increasing tree girths. The forest stand contained a growing population, but there was considerable variation in basal area distribution between the plots. Trends in species population structure varied, particularly for selective-felled species. Most species exhibited clumped dispersion of individuals both at 0.25 ha and 1-ha scales.

The Himalaya, a global biodiversity hotspot, lacks spatially explicit representation of plant richness patterns and predictor environmental covariates. The rugged Himalayan terrain limits large-scale field surveys, we, therefore, disentangle the role of remotely sensed environmental proxies for characterization of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) and prediction of plant richness in an alpine area in WesternHimalaya. Alpine plant richness was recorded in cluster plots (10 random quadrants of 1m(2) in approximately 1-ha area) across 97 sites in Pithoragarh district in part of the Western Himalaya(India). The dominant PFTs were mapped based on support vector machine classification of Landsat 8 image. Thesatellite-derived climate, landscape,and topographic variables were correlated to plant richness using generalized linear model (GLM) with poisson distribution to unravel species richness-environment linkages in the study area. The dominant PFTs mapped were herbaceous meadow, Danthonia grassland, Kobresia sedge meadow, moist scrub, and dry scrub. The GLM based plant richness model explained 70% variation in alpine plant richness.

,,,A1806,384,1807,Restoring and Conserving Khasi Forests: A Community-Based REDD Strategy from Northeast India,"An initiative to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) was launched in December 2007 at the Bali Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), yet little progress has been made in Asia in developing certified REDD projects, especially those that engage forest-dependent people. According to UNFCCC, REDD is a multilevel activity that involves both national policy and structures, as well as subnational projects involving local communities [1]. While many Asian nations are trying to create frameworks that link the national strategy to sub-national projects, in India this formal integration has yet to take place. As a consequence projects like the Khasi Hills Community REDD+ project fall outside the UNFCCC strategy and operate under voluntary standards (Plan Vivo) and markets. The project involves both avoided deforestation and reforestation components. The project is being implemented by a federation of ten Khasi tribal kingdoms, a major ethnolinguistic group in the Indian state of Meghalaya. Project experience may provide guidance regarding actions required to create a more enabling environment for community forest carbon projects in Asia. These findings may better inform the December 2015 21st UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Paris as they again address REDD strategy. The experience of this Khasi Federation [2] in designing and implementing a REDD project has led to the emergence of a modernizing forest management system that is helping to conserve and restore the Khasi's ancestral forests. Learning from this REDD project also illustrates the barriers that the Khasi communities have faced, including those imposed by national governments, certifiers, and carbon markets, that will likely constrain the expansion and replication of community-based climate initiatives. The author suggests some alternative policies and systems that may enable greater community participation in REDD projects.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.3390/f6124382,2015,FORESTS,"Poffenberger, M",,,Hydrochemistry; Rain shadow rivers; Weathering; Downstream hydrochemical trend; Southern Western Ghats,MAJOR ION CHEMISTRY; SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY; WEATHERING PROCESSES; ELEMENT CHEMISTRY; CO2 CONSUMPTION; SMALL CATCHMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; GEOCHEMISTRY; AMAZON; BASIN,University of Kerala,"[Thomas, Jobin; Joseph, Sabu] Univ Kerala, Dept Environm Sci, Thiruvananthapuram 695581, Kerala, India; [Thrivikramji, K.

Population structure of I. griffithii Hook. f. Thorns. was studied by observing number of individuals of the species during 2003-2004 in three stands experiencing different degrees of disturbance in temperate broad-leaved forest of Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India. Individuals were categorized based on diameter classes, i.e. seedlings (0-2 cm), saplings (> 2-6 cm) and trees (> 6 cm). The stand density of trees (> 6 cm diameter ranges from 564 ha(-1) in disturbed stand to 904 ha in undisturbed stand while basal area was recorded highest in undisturbed stand, (12.55 m(2) ha(-1)) and lowest in highly disturbed stand (6.04 m(2) ha(-1)). The density-diameter class distribution (individuals per hectare) follows the trend: seedlings < saplings < trees in all the three stands. This clearly indicates that the regeneration status of I. griffithii is poor. The diameter distribution pattern indicates decreasing number of individuals in higher diameter classes. This may be due to the harvesting of higher girth individuals for firewood and other purposes by local people. The overall population structure of I. griffithii reveals the dominance of adult individuals in the three stands, which emphasized the negative role of disturbance adversely impacting the regeneration of L griffithii. On the other hand, due to free access, there is unchecked exploitation. Anyone can extract as much as (s)he can. Therefore, a policy should be made to protect the species legally.

Here we studied a tropical montane landscape where old-growth evergreen forest occurs as patchy formations in a matrix of natural grasslands, to test the influence of environment and connectivity on species turnover and woody plant metacommunity structure. LocationWestern and southern regions of the Upper Nilgiri Plateau, Western Ghats, southern India. MethodsWe sampled 85 vegetation plots located across a 600-km(2) landscape, assembled environmental data, constructed contrasting spatial connectivity models, including models for the effects of topography on structural connectivity, and used RDA-based variation partitioning to assess the relative influence of environment and space on woody plant metacommunity structure. ResultsConsidering several environmental and multi-scale spatial predictors, we could explain half of the variation in plant community structure. Environmental and habitat factors such as precipitation, temperature seasonality, elevation, fragment size and landscape context play a dominant role, explaining approximately 40% of variation. Spatial predictors based on Euclidean distance performed better than those that accounted for topographic resistance. Spatial predictors accounted for only 9% of the variation in plant metacommunity structure. ConclusionOur results support the species sorting paradigm of metacommunity structure, as abiotic effects and biotic interactions play dominant roles in influencing community structure and species turnover in these old-growth forests, with a comparatively small influence of spatial connectivity. Effective management of woody species diversity would therefore require conservation of these forests across the range of environmental conditions under which they occur.",y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12474,2017,JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,"Das, AA; John, R; Anand, M",,,RISAT-1; Hybrid polarimetry; Classification; Support vector machine,BIOMASS; CLASSIFICATION; BACKSCATTER; RECOGNITION,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)","[Padalia, Hitendra; Yadav, Sadhana] ISRO, Forestry & Ecol Dept, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India","Padalia, H (corresponding author), ISRO, Forestry & Ecol Dept, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, forest/non-forest classification and estimation of forest above ground biomass over tropical regions are very important and relevant in understanding the contribution of tropical forests in global biogeochemical cycles, especially in terms of carbon pools and fluxes. Information on the spatio-temporal biomass distribution acts as a key input to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) action plans. This necessitates precise and reliable methods to estimate forest biomass and to reduce uncertainties in existing biomass quantification scenarios. The use of backscatter information from a host of all-weather capable Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems during the recent past has demonstrated the potential of SAR data in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/nonforest classification. In the present study, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data along with field inventory data have been used in forest above ground biomass estimation and forest/non-forest classification over Odisha state, India. The ALOS-PALSAR 50m spatial resolution orthorectified and radiometrically corrected HH/HV dual polarization data (digital numbers) for the year 2010 were converted to backscattering coefficient images (Schimada et al., 2009). The tree level measurements collected during field inventory (2009-'10) on Girth at Breast Height (GBH at 1.3m above ground) and height of all individual trees at plot (plot size 0.1ha) level were converted to biomass density using species specific allometric equations and wood densities. The field inventory based biomass estimations were empirically integrated with ALOS-PALSAR backscatter coefficients to derive spatial forest above ground biomass estimates for the study area. Further, The Support Vector Machines (SVM) based Radial Basis Function classification technique was employed to carry out binary (forest-non forest) classification using ALOS-PALSAR HH and HV backscatter coefficient images and field inventory data. The textural Haralick's Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures are determined on HV backscatter image for Odisha, for the year 2010. PALSAR HH, HV backscatter coefficient images, their difference (HH-HV) and HV backscatter coefficient based eight textural parameters (Mean, Variance, Dissimilarity, Contrast, Angular second moment, Homogeneity, Correlation and Contrast) are used as input parameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM) tool. Ground based inputs for forest/non-forest were taken from field inventory data and high resolution Google maps. Results suggested significant relationship between HV backscatter coefficient and field based biomass (R-2 = 0.508, p = 0.55) compared to HH with biomass values ranging from 5 to 365 t/ha. The spatial variability of biomass with reference to different forest types is in good agreement. The forest/non-forest classified map suggested a total forest cover of 50214 km(2) with an overall accuracy of 92.54%. The forest/non-forest information derived from the present study showed a good spatial agreement with the standard forest cover map of Forest Survey of India (FSI) and corresponding published area of 50575 km(2).

Until recently, spatial ecological database in India was almost non-existent. There is need of a robust and quality database of the biological diversity at species, community, ecosystem and landscape levels for identification of vulnerable ecosystems and risk species. in order to have a national level database on the spatial distribution of biological diversity, a nationwide project on the biodiversity characterization at landscape level was implemented and studies were carried out between 1998 and 2010 to characterize and map the flowering plants richness in the forested landscapes. The spatial database on vegetation types generated from temporal IRS LISS-III satellite imagery, road/rail network and settlements from topomaps and high-resolution satellite images, and species richness from field sampling were used to generate the spatially explicit species distribution maps and statistics. This study has resulted in the creation of a large baseline spatial database on vegetation types, porosity, patchiness, interspersion, juxtaposition, fragmentation, disturbance regimes, ecosystem uniqueness, terrain complexity and biological richness.",Y,Plot-based or transects,no DOI (manual),2012,CURRENT SCIENCE,"Roy, PS; Karnatak, H; Kushwaha, SPS; Roy, A; Saran, S",,,Cretaceous-Tertiary; historical biogeography; lineage diversification; rainforest adaptation; overseas dispersal,SPECIES RICHNESS; OCEAN CURRENTS; DISPERSAL; DIVERSIFICATION; DIVERGENCE; HYPOTHESIS; VICARIANCE; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; RADIATION,Braunschweig University of Technology; University of Milan; Wageningen University & Research; Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN),"[Crottini, Angelica; Strauss, Axel; Vences, Miguel] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Div Evolutionary Biol, Inst Zool, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Crottini, Angelica] Univ Milan, Sez Zool & Citol, Dipartimento Biol, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Madsen, Ole] Wageningen Univ, Anim Breeding & Genom Ctr, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; [Poux, Celine] Univ Sci & Technol Lille, Univ Lille Nord France, Lab Genet & Evolut Populat Vegetales, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Poux, Celine] CNRS, Unite Mixte Rech UMR 8198, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Poux, Celine] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Vertebrate Dept, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [Vieites, David R.] CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, E-28006 Madrid, Spain","Vences, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Div Evolutionary Biol, Inst Zool, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Lille 1 University-Science and Technology; Volkswagen Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Science Foundation [EF-0334939]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2009-10198]; Universita degli Studi di Milano; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/72908/2010]; University of Lille 1,Green Published,,,,,,,,,

,,,A1063,399,1064,"Forest biomass estimation using remote sensing and field inventory: a case study of Tripura, India","Forests are the potential source for managing carbon sequestration, regulating climate variations and balancing universal carbon equilibrium between sources and sinks. Further, assessment of biomass, carbon stock, and its spatial distribution is prerequisite for monitoring the health of forest ecosystem. Moreover, vegetation field inventories are valuable source of data for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB), density, and the carbon stored in biomass of forest vegetation. In view of the importance of biomass, the present study makes an attempt to estimate temporal AGB of Tripura State, India, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and the field inventory data through geospatial techniques. A model was developed for establishing the relationship between biomass, LAI, and NDVI in the selected study site. The study also aimed to improve method for quantifying and verifying inventory-based biomass stock estimation. The results demonstrate the correlation value obtained between LAI and NDVI were 0.87 and 0.53 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The correlation value between estimated AGB with LAI were found as 0.66 and 0.69, while with NDVI, the values were obtained as 0.64 and 0.94 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The regression model of measured biomass with MODIS NDVI and LAI was developed for the data obtained during the period 2011-2014. The developed model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of biomass and its relationship between LAI and NDVI. The R-2 values obtained were 0.832 for estimated and the measured AGB during the training and 0.826 for the validation. The results indicate that the methodology adopted in this study can help in selecting best fit model for analyzing relationship between AGB and NDVI/LAI and for estimating biomass using allometric equation at various spatial scales. The developed output thematic map showed an average biomass distribution of 32-94 Mg ha(-1). The highest biomass values (72-95 Mg ha (-1)) was confined to the dense region of the forest while the lowest biomass values (32-46 Mg ha(-1)) was identified in the outer regions of the study site.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7730-7,2019,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,"Pandey, PC; Srivastava, PK; Chetri, T; Choudhary, BK; Kumar, P",,,,GARHWAL HIMALAYA; FUELWOOD USE; PATTERNS; BIOMASS; INDIA; PRODUCTIVITY; CONSUMPTION; TRANSITION; FORESTS; WISDOM,University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Conservation International; Trinity University,"[Jagadish, Arundhati; Dwivedi, Puneet; McEntire, Kira D.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Jagadish, Arundhati] Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [McEntire, Kira D.] Trinity Univ, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Chandar, Mamta] Jagriti, Kulu 175101, Himachal Prades, India","Jagadish, A (corresponding author), Conservat Int, 2011 Crystal Dr,Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [83542101],,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying this change may lead to a better understanding of the ecology and the effective management of invasive species. We used data on density of the highly invasive shrub Lantana camara (lantana) for the period 1990-2008 from a 50 ha permanent plot in a seasonally dry tropical forest of Mudumalai in southern India. We used a cumulative link mixed-effects regression approach to model the transition of lantana from one qualitative density state to another as a function of biotic factors such as indicators of competition from local species (lantana itself, perennial grasses, invasive Chromolaena odorata, the native shrub Helicteres isora and basal area of native trees) and abiotic factors such as fire frequency, inter-annual variability of rainfall and relative soil moisture. The density of lantana increased substantially during the study period. Lantana density was negatively associated with the density of H. isora, positively associated with basal area of native trees, but not affected by the presence of grasses or other invasive species. In the absence of fire, lantana density increased with increasing rainfall. When fires occurred, transitions to higher densities occurred at low rainfall values. In drier regions, lantana changed from low to high density as rainfall increased while in wetter regions of the plot, lantana persisted in the dense category irrespective of rainfall. Lantana seems to effectively utilize resources distributed in space and time to its advantage, thus outcompeting local species and maintaining a population that is not yet self-limiting. High-risk areas and years could potentially be identified based on inferences from this study for facilitating management of lantana in tropical dry forests.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076995,2013,PLOS ONE,"Ramaswami, G; Sukumar, R",,,Public health; Watershed management; Perceptions; Tribal; Empowerment,MIGRANT; VIOLENCE,Karolinska Institutet,"[Nerkar, Sandeep S.; Tamhankar, Ashok J.; Johansson, Eva; Lundborg, Cecilia Stalsby] Karolinska Inst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Global Hlth IHCAR, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nerkar, Sandeep S.; Tamhankar, Ashok J.] RD Gardi Med Coll, Dept Environm Med, Indian Initiat Management Antibiot Resistance, Ujjain 456006, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Tamhankar, Ashok J.] NG Acharya & DK Marathe Coll, Bombay 400071, Maharashtra, India; [Johansson, Eva] Nord Sch Publ Hlth, Gothenburg, Sweden","Nerkar, SS (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Global Hlth IHCAR, Tomtebodavagen 18 A, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Green Published, gold",,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, soil carbon was higher in site II (183.5 Mg C/ha) than site I (172.3 Mg C/ha). Soil bulk density increased with increase in soil depth in both sites. Cumulatively, even though both sites had almost equal carbon stocks, they show considerable variation in the amount of carbon stocked in their carbon pools.

A total of 1500 quadrats distributed over five, 3-ha permanent plots in five sites, differing in degree of disturbance, were used to enumerate and measure the tree species. A total of 65 species with 136,983 individuals were enumerated in the total 15-ha area for stems >= 30 cm height. The number of species and number of stems ranged from 12 to 50 and 8063 - 65331 per 3-ha area. The number of species and stems for trees >= 10 cm dbh ranged from 3 to 28 species, with a mean value of 16 species ha(-1), and from 16 to 477 stems, with a mean value of 256 stems ha(-1), respectively. The adult based PCA ordination indicated uniqueness of sites in terms of species composition and habitat characteristics. PCA ordination also showed uniqueness of sites in terms of seedling composition, but the seedling and adult distributions were not spatially associated. The distinct species composition at the different sites and at the two life-cycle stages on the same site is indicative of marked spatio-temporal dynamics of the dry tropical forest. The density - diameter semi-logarithmic curves ranged from a near linear to an overall concave appearance with a limited plateau in the mid-diameter ranges. The alpha-diversity and its components decreased with increasing disturbance intensity, reflecting enhanced utilization pressure with increasing disturbance. The site-wise and species-wise regression analyses of the number of individuals in different stages of the species revealed that both the level of disturbance and the nature of species strongly affect the regeneration.

The plant communities of the three selected stands (S1, S2, and S3) of this forest were categorized into three vegetation strata: overstory trees, understory trees and shrubs, and a ground layer with scattered herbs and tree seedlings. The three stands contained 44, 19, and 8 species in each stratum, respectively, and three climber species. Importance value index (IVI) and basal area/cover did not show a clear dominance for particular species, and this is identified as a mixed forest with deciduous as well as evergreen species. Therefore, dominant species in each layer were categorized according to an IVI value of 10 and greater than 10% relative basal area. Within each stratum, species richness and plant population density decreased with an increase in plant size. Both species diversity and productivity were relatively high compared to the reference site because of protection from biotic disturbances, which cannot be controlled on the reference site. Creation of new forest on the barren land has contributed significant soil amelioration in the degraded sodic soil of the Indogangetic plains. The soil properties of the three stands did not vary much, although different tree species dominated the stands. Maximum soil amelioration was recorded for total N, followed by mineralized N, available N, and organic carbon contents for the nutritional properties. With regard to chemical properties, exchangeable sodium was greatly reduced in comparison to other properties viz pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable Ca content. During 40 years of growth and development of the diverse vegetation in the revegetated forest, microbial C increased to about five times that of the surrounding barren sodic soils. There were no significant changes in soil structure even though the water-holding capacity of the soil improved to about 53% of the once barren land due to a 7-fold increase in organic carbon content.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2005.00005.x,2005,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,"Tripathi, KP; Singh, B",,,conservation; human disturbance; monodominance; permanent plot; sacred groves; tree diversity; tropical dry evergreen forest,SCALE PERMANENT PLOT; RAIN-FOREST; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PLANT BIODIVERSITY; DECIDUOUS FOREST; WESTERN-GHATS; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; MONODOMINANCE; FLORISTICS,Pondicherry University,"Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India","Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Salim Ali Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",,,,,,,,,,,

They affect not only the species diversity of native areas but also their biological integrity. In India, a number of invasive exotic weeds have been reported but some viz. Parthenium hysterophorus, Lantana camara and Ageratum conyzoides, especially those from tropical America are troublesome and have caused adverse ecological, economic and social impact. These weeds can be seen growing in different landscapes but are luxuriantly localized in unattended forests and cultivated areas. Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae, commonly known as congress grass) is perhaps the most troublesome and noxious weed of urban and rural India. Besides rapidly colonizing areas replacing the native vegetation, it is also known to cause a number of human health problems such as skin allergy, rhinitis and irritation to eyes of the residents in the vicinity. Likewise, it causes fodder scarcity in addition to being unpalatable and toxic to livestock. Lantana camara (Verbenaceae), another serious tropical American pest, has encroached upon large areas of land, especially the forests where it has virtually replaced the forest floor vegetation and reduced tree growth. Also because of its bushy and spreading type of growth it obstructs forest operations. The third weed, Ageratum conyzoides (Asteraceae, Billy goat weed) has invaded agricultural fields. It interferes with crops and causes yield reductions of major staple crops of India. When it invades rangeland areas, it out competes native grasses causing scarcity of fodder. These weeds have similar growth strategies such as fast growth rates, short life-cycles, greater reproductive potential, high competitive abilities and allelopathy that make them successful invaders of native habitats. Mechanical, chemical, biological and cultural control tactics have failed individually, though integrated approaches combining all these approaches along with community participation and proper land management have been relatively successful.

We determined the relative influence of these two mechanisms by examining variation in flocks across nine rain-forest fragments (range 11-2600 ha) in a plantation landscape in the Western Ghats, India. We found differences between fragments in average number of species (range 10.8-15.2) and individuals (range 19.0-37.6) per flock, number of species that participated in flocks (range 34-59), encounter rates (range 0.5-2.4 flocks h(-1)) and flock composition. Multiple regression and randomization tests revealed that different mechanisms contributed to this variation. Three flock variables (openforest individuals per flock, total open-forest species that participated in flocks in a fragment, flock composition) mainly reflected changes in the bird communities of fragments. Habitat structure strongly influenced three flock variables (open-forest species per flock, total and rain-forest individuals per flock) and flock composition to a lesser extent. Finally, flock encounter rate was strongly related to fragment area, but not to abundance of flock participants indicating habitat degradation-induced changes in propensities of species to flock.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467408004823,2008,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Sridhar, H; Sankar, K",,,groundwater; aravalli quartzite; lineaments; buried pediment plains; NDVI,GIS,"Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Applicat Remote Sensing Lab, New Delhi 110067, India","Mukherjee, S (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Applicat Remote Sensing Lab, New Mehrauli Rd, New Delhi 110067, India.",,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,,,,,,,
,,,A2850,411,2851,"Tree density, basal area and species diversity in a disturbed dry tropical forest of northern India: implications for conservation","Dry tropical forest communities are among the world's most threatened systems and urgent measures are required to protect and restore them in degraded landscapes. For planning conservation strategies, there is a need to determine the few essential measurable properties, such as number of species and basal area, that best describe the dry forest vegetation and its environment, and to document quantitative relationships among them. This paper examines the relationships between forest basal area and diversity components (number of species and evenness) for a disturbed dry tropical forest of northern India. Data were collected from five sites located in the Vindhyan dry tropical forest of India, selected on the basis of satellite images and field observations to represent the entire range of conditions in terms of canopy cover and disturbance regimes. These sites represented different communities in terms of species composition. The forest was poorer in species richness, and lower in stem density and basal area than wet forests of the tropics. Across sites (communities), the diversity components and tree density were positively related with total tree basal area. Considering basal area as a surrogate of biomass and net production, diversity is found to be positively associated with productivity. A positive relationship between basal area, tree density and species diversity may be an important characteristic of the dry forest, where recurring disturbance does not permit concentration of biomass or stems in only a few strong competitors. However, the relationships of basal area with density, alpha diversity and evenness remain statistically significant only when data from all sites, including the extremely disturbed one, are used in the analysis. In some sites there was a greater coefficient of variation (CV) of basal area than in others, attributed to patchy distribution of stems and resultant blanks. Therefore, to enhance the tree diversity of these forests, the variability in tree basal area must be reduced by regulating local disturbances. Conservation activities, particularly fuelwood plantations near human settlements, deferred grazing and canopy enrichment through multi-species plantations of nursery-raised or wild-collected seedlings of desirable species within the forest patches of low basal area, will be needed to attain restoration goals, but reforestation programmes will have to be made attractive to the forest-dwelling communities.",Y,Plot-based,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892906003237,2006,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,"Sagar, R; Singh, JS",,,FIA; subtropical dry forest; biomass; stem volume; Puerto Rico; Caribbean; additive models,TROPICAL FORESTS; INVENTORY; BRAZIL; TREE,United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service,"USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA; Delaney Forestry Serv LLC, Albany, OR 97321 USA; USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, Asheville, NC 28804 USA","Brandeis, TJ (corresponding author), USDA, US Forest Serv, So Res Stn, 4700 Old Kingston Pike, Knoxville, TN 37919 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,

The study area had five prevailing land uses viz., agriculture, agro-horticulture, horticulture, silvi-pasture, and forest at four elevations representing about 1 A degrees C temperature change. The results showed that maximum total biomass of 404.35 Mg C ha(-1) was accumulated by forest landuse and followed a decreasing trend in the order as forest > silvi-pasture > agro-horticulture > horticulture > agriculture. Similar trends were also seen with respect to biomass carbon (C) density and C-sequestration potential of different land uses. Biomass and carbon density potential enhanced with the increase in the altitudinal ranges from 1100-1400 to 2000-2300 m a.s.l. But, the rate of C-sequestration potential enhanced from 1100 to 2000 m and declined at 2000-2300 m a.s.l. Maximum carbon density (393.29 Mg C ha(-1)) of both plant as well as soil was displayed by the forest-based land use systems situated at an altitudinal gradient of 2000-2300 m a.s.l. The rate of C-sequestration was maximum (2.17 Mg ha(-1)) in the agro-horticulture at 2000-2300 m a.s.l.

,,,A0697,414,698,Edge effects alter the role of fungi and insects in mediating functional composition and diversity of seedling recruits in a fragmented tropical forest,"Abstract Background and Aims In fragmented forests, proximity to forest edges can favour the establishment of resource-acquisitive species over more resource-conservative species. During seedling recruitment, resource-acquisitive species may benefit from either higher light availability or weaker top-down effects of natural enemies. The relative importance of light and enemies for recruitment has seldom been examined with respect to edge effects. Methods In a human-modified wet tropical forest in India, we first examined how functional traits indicative of resource-acquisitive vs. resource-conservative strategies, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content, wood density and seed size, explained interspecific differences in densities of seedling recruits with distance to the forest edge. Then, we checked whether fungicide and insecticide treatments and canopy openness (proxy for light availability) explained edge effects on trait-mediated changes in seedling density. Finally, we examined whether light availability and natural enemy activity explained edge effects on functional diversity of seedling recruits. Key Results Up to 60 m from edges, recruit densities increased with decreasing seed size, but not at 90â€“100 m, where recruit densities increased with higher SLA. Trait-mediated variation in recruit densities changed with pesticides only at 90â€“100 m: compared with control plots, fungicide increased recruit densities for low SLA species and insecticide increased smaller seeded species. For SLA, wood density and seed size, functional diversity of recruits was higher at 90â€“100 m than at 0â€“5 m. At 90â€“100 m, fungicide decreased functional diversity for SLA and insecticide reduced seed size diversity compared with control plots. Canopy openness explained neither variation in recruit density in relation to traits nor functional diversity. Conclusions Altered biotic interactions can mediate local changes to trait composition and functional diversity during seedling recruitment in forest fragments, hinting at downstream effects on the structure and function of human-modified forests.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcaa138,2020,ANNALS OF BOTANY,"Krishnadas, M; Agarwal, K; Comita, LS",,,Canonical correspondence analysis; Environmental variables; Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve; Species richness; Western Himalaya,GLOBALLY CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIP; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ELEVATION GRADIENT; ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT; FOREST COMMUNITIES; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; KUMAUN HIMALAYA; TAXON RICHNESS; DISTURBANCE; CARBON,,"[Rawat, Balwant; Negi, Arvind Singh] Graph Era Hill Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India","Rawat, B (corresponding author), Graph Era Hill Univ, Sch Agr Sci, Dehra Dun 248002, Uttarakhand, India.","SERB, Govt. of India [TAR/2018/001033]",,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, anthropogenic alteration of natural landscapes leading to land use and land cover change, habitat loss, and species extinctions (may) have putatively disturbed this relationship. Hence, it is important to study the nature of the relationship in such human influenced landscapes. Methods: In this study, we endeavored to understand the consistency of the relationship in the fragmented natural landscapes in the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia hills of Meghalaya in northeast India, with Adinandra griffithii (an endangered endemic tree) as a model species. We reconstructed the distribution of its suitable habitats as a function of the remotely sensed vegetation phenology (i.e., EVI data), using point occurrence data and ecological niche modeling (ENM) tool. Estimation of the abundance and habitat characterization was done through field surveys following standard methods. Results: The study revealed that remotely sensed landscape-level vegetation phenology could effectively discriminate the suitable and unsuitable habitats of threatened species. Linear regression model showed a weak positive correlation between abundance and predicted habitat suitability for adult trees indicating (plausible) deterioration in the relationship. However, sapling and seedling populations did not show a precise trend in this respect. Field-based studies revealed that removal of the species from the suitable habitats because of anthropogenic disturbances possibly weakened the abundance-suitability relationship. Conclusions: The findings of the study enjoin the need for re-establishment of the species in the suitable areas for its conservation and perpetuation.",Y,Unsure,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13717-018-0114-z,2018,ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Adhikari, D; Mir, AH; Upadhaya, K; Iralu, V; Roy, DK",,,Passive buildings; Field data; Decision trees; Comfort; Data representation,LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; DECISION TREE; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION; OPERATION,Polytechnic University of Milan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; CEPT University,"[Geronazzo, Angela] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Informat Elettron & Bioingn, Milan, Italy; [Brager, Gail] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Built Environm, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Manu, Sanyogita] CEPT Univ, Ctr Adv Res Bldg Sci & Energy, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India","Geronazzo, A (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Informat Elettron & Bioingn, Milan, Italy.","U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (GOI) under the U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research (PACE-R) program's U.S.-India Joint Center for Building Energy Research and Development (CBERD) project; U.S. DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231]",,,,,,,,,,
,,,A1985,416,1986,Restoration of rain forest beneath pine plantations: A relay floristic model with special application to tropical South Asia,"In the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP's comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum). Financial analyses reveal that pine plantations that are enrichment planted and cultivated with rain forest timber and non-timber species can provide superior economic benefits as compared to land cultivated singly for tea.

Such habitat fragmentation may be detrimental to species with specialized habitat and foraging requirements and their ability to persist in such landscapes may depend on their adaptability to habitat modification. Great Hombills Buceros bicornis, among the largest birds in Asian tropical rainforests, depend on large trees for nesting and a diverse array of patchily distributed fruiting trees. In the human-modified landscape of the Anamalai Hills, India, we compared the breeding biology and nesting behaviour of Great Hombills in contiguous rainforest (N=3 nests) and in modified habitat consisting of coffee plantations and rainforest fragments (N=5 nests). The nesting cycle of seven of the eight nests monitored varied between 114 and 130 days. Nest provisioning behaviour was similar in contiguous forest and modified habitat in terms of visitation and food delivery rates, but visitation tended to be higher and food delivery rate lower during the nestling phase than during incubation. As expected, tree density and native food plant diversity were lower in modified habitat than in continuous forest. The diversity of food provisioned was lower in modified habitat with a 57.5% dietary overlap with contiguous forest.

To this end, a massive vegetation data set, consisting of 51,834 4-variate observations has been clustered into different landscapes by Nagendra and Gadgil [Current Sci. 75 (1998) 264-271]. But a study of such importance may be affected by nonuniqueness of cluster analysis and the lack of methods for quantifying uncertainty of the clusterings obtained. Motivated by this applied problem of much scientific importance, we propose a new methodology for obtaining the global, as well as the local modes of the posterior distribution of clustering, along with the desired credible and highest posterior density regions in a nonparametric Bayesian framework. To meet the need of an appropriate metric for computing the distance between any two clusterings, we adopt and provide a much simpler, but accurate modification of the metric proposed in [In Felicitation Volume in Honour of Prof. B. K. Kale (2009) MacMillan]. A very fast and efficient Bayesian methodology, based on [Sankhya Ser. B 70 (2008) 133-155], has been utilized to solve the computational problems associated with the massive data and to obtain samples from the posterior distribution of clustering on which our proposed methods of summarization are illustrated. Clustering of the Western Ghats data using our methods yielded landscape types different from those obtained previously, and provided interesting insights concerning the differences between the results obtained by Nagendra and Gadgil [Current Sci. 75 (1998) 264-271] and us.

In this study, the relationship between Lantana camara invasion and native forest understorey vegetation was described after accounting for environmental influences. Rainfall, terrain slope, altitude and fire frequency were measured from GIS layers, and tree density, dry above-ground L. camara biomass, and native plant abundance and species richness were measured in nested plots (four 1 x 1-m plots for grass, tree seedlings and L. camara within one 5-m-radius plot for tree saplings and herbs and shrubs within one 10-m-radius plot for trees) at 80 locations distributed across Bandipur Tiger Reserve, a tropical deciduous forest in southern India. Relationships between environmental factors and L. camara abundance were described using a multiple regression. Further, the role of L. camara abundance in explaining residual variation in native vegetation, after accounting for environmental influences, was described using linear models. Lantana camara abundance decreased with increasing tree density, supporting the notion that it thrives in disturbed forest with fewer trees. Whereas native tree seedling and herb and shrub density showed no relationship to L. camara abundance, both tree sapling density and grass volume decreased under L. camara biomass exceeding 2 kg m(-2). These data suggest that, by association with grass decline and decreased recruitment of tree saplings. L. camara may be linked to the gradual transition of these tropical deciduous forests into exotic-dominated shrubland, and overall native biodiversity loss.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0266467411000563,2012,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,"Prasad, AE",,,C; Land-use; Labile carbon; Recalcitrant carbon; Organic carbon fractions; Soil microbial biomass,MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-MATTER; MANAGEMENT; SEQUESTRATION; DYNAMICS; YIELD; FRACTIONS; ROTATION; TILLAGE; RATIOS,Punjab Agricultural University,"[Benbi, D.

The relationship between species richness, aboveground biomass and carbon stock at different altitudes can have crucial implications for the management and conservation of carbon sinks. The study was undertaken to assessthe aboveground biomass and carbon stock in ten forest stands along an altitudinal gradient in Manipur, Northeast India. Stand density varied from 128 to 168 trees ha(-1) across the study sites with the highest stand density at higher altitude. The aboveground biomass varied between 124.56 and 254.99 t ha(-1) and carbon stock ranged from 60.09 to 121.43 t C ha(-1) across the study sites. Our results show that there is a significant positive correlation of stand density, aboveground biomass and carbon stock with increasing altitude. This positive relationship could be attributed to less disturbance and the dominance of larger trees at higher altitudes as compared to lower altitudes.

The study was conducted along the timberline stretch of Dzongri landscape nested within the Khangchendzonga National Park (UNESCO's World Heritage Site, 2016), a core zone of Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (in UNESCO WNBRs, 2018), Sikkim, India. We employed quadrat method to sample 9 contiguous sites to capture all possible variations in timberline composition. Transect method was used to study the regeneration of woody taxa between timberline to treeline. In total, 20 woody species belonging to 10 genera and 6 families were recorded. Among these, Abies densa, Rhododendron lanatum and Sorbus microphylla exhibited higher dominance, comprising of 50% of the total importance value index (IVI) weightage. Betula utilis the common treeline species in much of the western and central parts of Himalaya was absent here. Tree density in studied timberline was significantly higher than its western Himalayan counterparts of Indian Himalayan region. Environmental variables viz., elevation, slope, and humus were observed determinants of species composition across the study area. The species dominance correlated negatively (p<0.01; n = 9) with species diversity and richness. We observed an irregular spatial pattern of timberline across the 9 study sites, and the extent of timberline elements (seedling; sapling; live tree or dead tree) ranged between 5.3m to 187.7m higher than the current timberline at different sites. The present trends suggest that upslope advancement is unlikely to occur in near future, while treeline densification is anticipated.

(Sal) is one of the important timber-yielding plants in India, which dominates the vegetation of Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh state in India forming various communities based on its associations. The present study deals with delineation, mapping and characterization of various communities of Sal (Shorea robusta) forests in Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh, India ranging across over 16 districts. Field survey and visual interpretation based forest vegetation type classification and mapping was carried out as part of the project entitled 'Biodiversity characterization at landscape level using remote sensing and GIS'. Indian Remote Sensing-P6 (Resourcesat-1) Linear Imaging Self Scanner-III satellite data was used during the study. The total area covered by different Sal forests was found to be approximately 2256.77 km(2). Sal communities were identified and characterized based on their spectral properties, physiognomy and phytosociological characteristics. Following nine Sal communities were identified, delineated and mapped with reasonable accuracy viz., Chandar, Damar, dry plains, moist plains, western alluvium, western alluvium plains, mixed moist deciduous, mixed dry deciduous and Siwalik. It is evident from the area estimates that mixed moist deciduous Sal is the most dominant community in the region covering around (1613.90 km(2)), other major communities were found as western alluvium plains Sal (362.44 km(2)), mixed dry deciduous Sal (362.44 km(2)) and dry plains Sal (107.71 km(2)). The Terai landscape of Uttar Pradesh faces tremendous anthropogenic pressure leading to deterioration of the forests.

Field surveys were carried out at 46 selected sites during August 2015 to May 2016. In each site, the vegetative structure and regeneration status were assessed using the quadrat method. Altogether 219 quadrates were laid out and a total of 13 true mangrove species, belonging to 5 families and 8 genera, were recorded. The total tree density and stand basal area of the study region was 1678.08/ha and 20.33m(2)/ha respectively. The low basal areas indicate the reduced structural development in mangroves. Of the 13 tree species, Avicennia constitutes 56% of the total Important Value Index (IVI) and Avicennia officinalis represents 41% of the IVI in Kerala, followed by Avicennia marina (15%), Rhizophora mucronata (15%), Sonneratia alba (8%) Rhizophora apiculata (7%) and Excoecaria agallocha (7%). The diameter at breast height (DBH) in the study area revealed that 47% of the tree species came under the 1-10cm DBH class. Total sapling and seedling density in Kerala was 2238.35 and 3232.42 individuals/ha respectively. Density of young plants (seedlings+saplings) was only 31% greater of tree density and varied from 3-63%, which indicates poor regeneration potential. The Maturity index value (MIV) and complexity index (Ic) value of mangroves were 18.30 and 109.81 respectively. However, the low Ic value (<10) observed in seven out of ten coastal districts indicated poor structural development of mangroves in Kerala. Therefore, location-specific conservation and management measures, guided by the knowledge on spatial distribution and habitat requirements of mangrove varieties should be taken to preserve the mangrove diversity of Kerala.",Y,Plot-based or transects,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-018-0600-2,2019,JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH,"George, G; Krishnan, P; Mini, KG; Salim, SS; Ragavan, P; Tenjing, SY; Muruganandam, R; Dubey, SK; Gopalakrishnan, A; Purvaja, R; Ramesh, R",,,C-equivalent correction factor; TOC analyzer; LOI methods; soil organic carbon (SOC); Himalayan soils,WALKLEY-BLACK ANALYSIS; MATTER; RECOVERY; NITROGEN; ASSESSMENTS; SAMPLES,"Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS); Department of Space (DoS), Government of India; Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology; Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)","[Kumar, Suresh; Ghotekar, Yogesh Sopan] ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, India; [Dadhwal, Vinay K.] ISRO, Indian Inst Space Sci & Technol, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India","Kumar, S (corresponding author), ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, India.",ISRO-Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) of the Department of Space,Bronze,,,,,,,,,

,,,A3044,433,3045,Biomass carbon of truncated diameter classes in Indian forests,"One major uncertainty in estimating terrestrial carbon flux is the biomass density of the forests being cleared or re-growing. Several studies estimated the forest biomass density in different ways. But most of the studies have focused on forest volume inventories in estimating biomass of different forest types. The major drawback of these inventories is that they often report stand/stock tables only above a minimum diameter, reflecting the dominant interest in inventories of commercial volumes. Especially, in countries like India, where most of the forests are disturbed, they might contain important proportions of the stand biomass. The paper estimates the missing number of trees in the inventories using the frequency of stems in the higher diameter classes. Once the stem frequencies have been estimated completed stand tables may be used for biomass estimation. The study concludes that the error of omission of these small diameter classes is substantial as the inventories fail to include 29.7% of the total stand biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
