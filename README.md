## P1 - Meta-analysis diversty ~ predictors at an India scale [Babu et al.]

Q: Environmental correlates of tree (alpha) diversity in India (subcontinent?)

*Response*: 1) **plot-level alpha diversity** 2) **biomass / productivity** of each plot in a study gathered from 1) datasets 2) meta-analysis (picking plot info from other studies) 3) writing to folks to share their data/papers/meta-data with us.

*Intermediary for predictors*:
  - GPS locations of each plot: obtained (if given), inferred (if on a high-res map), requested (if we can email them), approximated (if all else fails)
  - Anthropogenic disturbance within plot (Y/N)

*Predictors*: **rainfall / temperature / rainfall seasonality / temperature seasonality / disturbance from fragmentation (edge effects) / disturbance within plots / soil**, etc.
**Some productivity measure and how that varies across biome**


*Predicted relationships and why*:
  - Y ~ rainfall; +ve
  - Y ~ temperature; +ve
  - Y ~ soil-N;
  - Y ~ soil-SOC;
  - Y ~ soil-P;
  - Y ~ rainfall seasonality**;
  - Y ~ temperature seasonality;
  - Y ~ disturbance_frag (no major disturbance in plot but forest edge is nearby (< 100m ?);
  - Y ~ disturbance_anth (major anthropogenic(?) disturbance in plot that has been recorded in the metadata);
  - Y ~ latitude;
  - Y ~ ??

\*: Fisher's alpha, species density, rarefied richness, shannon-diversity, simpsons diversity

\*\*: # of dry months, rain in the dry season, etc. [plethora of drought indices]

## P2 - Meta-analysis: who is doing forest/tree-diversity research? [Anujan et al]
